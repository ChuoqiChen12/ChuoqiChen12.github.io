**EECS413 Coursework Project**

**Duration**: *11/2021-01/2021*
**Content Description**:Circuit Design and physical design of a high-bandwidth and high gain TIA for photodiode
- Performance: 
    - DC Power Dissipation: 24.4515 mWatt
    - 3dB bandwidth: 3.5013 GHz
    - Different output slew rate: 1.143 V/ns
    - Total chip size: 465Ã—214 $\mu m^2$
- Implement Amplifier with Cascade structure, using Common Gate amplifier to isolate high input capacitance, Common Source amplifier to provide good gain. and Common Drain amplifier as voltage buffer to provide enough output voltage
- Use shunt peaking to extend stable gain in higher frequency, maximizing chip area efficiency by applying only essential inductors.
- Apply current mirror structure to all three amplifier stages to lower the difficulty of biasing.
