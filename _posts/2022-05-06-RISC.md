**Content Description**:Physical Design of RISC Processor from scratch.
- Implementing a RISC processor in Cadence Virtuoso supporting 45 instructions including Multiplication, add.
- Implementing a computer-in-memory processing element using 9T SRAM and ADC based on Sense Amplifier to accelerate multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) computation. 
- Fine-tuning compensation capacitance to obtain the precise matric-vector-multiplication (MVM) results.
- Implement physical layout techniques such as multi-fingers, repeaters design, power ring, multi-mental connection fixing Antenna Rules.
- Area: 517.6Ã—491.8 $\mu m^2$
