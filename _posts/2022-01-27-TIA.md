## Introduction
An optical fiber operates at 5 Gbbps. This project aims to design a CMOS wideband Transimpedance amplifier(TIA) that is capable of operating within a 5Gbps system. Lower bandwidth might cause pattern-dependant jitter and lower signal-to-noise ratio.  It is also important to ensure gain high enough that input signals generate output levels exceeding the sensitivity of the limiting amplifier that follows the TIA.

## Circuit Design
The 5Gbps optical system should have a maximum data frequency of 5Ghz and will require a TIA with at least 3.5Ghz bandwidth. This is to ensure minimum gain loss and distortion. As we learned in class, a single pole amplifier will continuously lose its gain
with the increase of operation frequency. To define a range of operations, we used -3dB bandwidth and considered a 3dB gain reduction, and around -45 degree phase shift is acceptable.

The bandwidth of our amplifier will be limited by the dominant pole. Therefore, with a frequency lower than or slightly higher than the bandwidth, the amplifier will behave like a single pole system. This means our amplifier will maintain its DC gain until the
bandwidth of 3.5Ghz, then drop off at a rate of 20db per decade until the second pole. At 5Ghz, this system will have a gain reduction around (5Ghz-3.5Ghz)/5Ghz / 10Gainper-dec * 20dB-per-dec = 3dB. As discussed previously, -3dB gain reduction still
provides high enough gain to maintain signal-to-noise ratio and low enough phase shift to avoid pattern-dependent jitter.

### Overall Design
The general structure of our design is made up of three stages. The first part is a common gate amplifier which isolate the input capacitance from the photodiode while still providing high transimpedance. The second part is a serier os common source amplifiers that maintains the high bandwidth of the common gate amplifier and provides good amplification. The third buffer is a common drain amplifier that acts as voltage buffer to provide enough output voltage.

### Common Gate Amplifier
In order to tolerate the high input capacitance as well as transforming the current input to voltage output, the frontend of the circuit was designed to be a common gate (CG) amplifier. The basic common gate amplifier structure is shown below.
