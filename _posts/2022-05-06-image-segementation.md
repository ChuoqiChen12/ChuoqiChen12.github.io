## Quick Review
In this project, we focus on the abdominal multi-organs segmentation problem. We purpose two novel neural network structures to solve two main problems: fragmental objects edges and failue to detect small, direction-dependent objects. The performance of medical image segmentation is expected to be enhanced by fusing Self Attention mechanism and convolutional neural network.
