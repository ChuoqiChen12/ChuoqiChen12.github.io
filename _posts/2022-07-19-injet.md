## Introduction
<p align="justify"> 
Neural probes play an important roles in medical and clinical application. With the help of neural probe, neuroscientists are able to know more about different brain regions and encode the signal of the brain. Hybrid system of neural probes and circuits is one of the important way to make neural probes system. However, as recording sites increased, it is challenging to make electrically connect between flexible probes and ASICs and PCB. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
Among all electrical connection techniques, flip-chip bonding is a commonly used method including bonding with anisotropic conductive films (ACF) etc. <a href = "#reference"> [1] </a> <a id = "ref1"></a> However, ACF need high temperature, high pressure, and high cost to fabricate. Therefore, developing a feasible, reliable, and high-throughput method to bond flexible probe and CMOS circuits together is necessary. There are a few prospective methods such as inkjet printing or solder ball printing. <a href = "#reference"> [2,3] </a> <a id = "ref2"></a> <a id = "ref3"></a> However, the size of solder ball is limited around 100μm, which limited the resolution of neural probes. Instead, inkjet is gaining importance due to the ease of deposition on 3D and high resolution, which is a potential bonding method for hybrid integration of flexible probe and CMOS circuits.  By introducing inkjet printing, the throughput of bonding could be greatly improved. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
This project aims to use Inkjet printer(Dimatix DMP2831) to connect the pads of a flexible probe to ASIC and/or PCB. By printing silver ink(SuntronicEMD 5730, conductive ink) on probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads, electrical connection is able to made between two components. One things to point out is that probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads are aligned in advance. As the printing doesn't require high temperature and high pressure, the 3D printing techniques has an advantage over the other methods with fine pitch and high throughput.</p>

## Experiment & Result
### Process
<ol>
  <li> Align flexible probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads </li>
  <li> Fill cartridge with enough conducsive ink</li>
  <li> Draw corresponding patterns same as pads </li>
  <li> Calibrate printing origin of the printer and calibrate theta</li>
  <li> Inkjet print ink on the substrate after setting printing origin and patterns</li>
  <li> Sinter the ink under high temperature(150-250℃) for some time</li>
  <li> Check printing results under microscope</li>
</ol>

### Results
After many times of test, there are two main problems appears during printing: leakage and misalignment.
#### Leakage

</p>

<p align="justify"> 
According above results, instead of forming a drop on the pads, the ink leak underneath the cables and probes because of surface tension force.</p>

Several solutions have been tried while all solutions failed for different reasons:
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify"> <b>Solution1</b>: Change the way how to place cable and wafer/mockup by using water or IPA with/without baking for better attachment.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify"> <b>Results1</b>: Cables might fold during alignment process and water or IPA with/without baking can not attach well enough with substrate. There's always gap between cable and substrate.</p></li>
  <br>
  <li> <p align="justify"><b>Solution2</b>: Increase the substrate temperature and accelerate evaporate rate before liquid start to expand.</p> </li>
  <li> <p align="justify"><b>Result2</b>: The ink still leak at the 60℃, the highest substrate temperature. 30, 45℃ has also been tested but leakage is still existed. It's because the sinter temperature is far higher than 60℃. What's worse higher substrate temperature have bad effect on cartridge nozzles, making easier to clog. </p> </li>
  <br>
  <li><p align="justify"><b>Solution3</b>: flip the cable might help block ink leak by using metal ring.</p></li>
  <li><p align="justify"><b>Result3</b>: Failed because there might still a large gap between cable and substrate. </p></li>
</ul>

#### Misalignment

</p>

The misalignement happens for a few reasons:
**Cartridge instability**
<ul>
  <li>The cartridge can only be used in 2-3 weeks. </li>
  <li>With too little ink in the cartridge, it will become very hard to control where it print. (~70 microns misalignment).</li>
  <li>It's easy to clog if the substrate temperature increase while it is expected to increase the temperature to accelerate ink evaporation.</li>
</ul>

**Tool Limitation**
<ul>
  <li> The misalignment often happens in X direction.</li>
  <li> The step of the motor of Y direction is much smaller than X direction: In X direction, 60μm movement is not reliable while Y direction can move to 10μm.</li>
  <li> According to the manual, the repeatability of the printer: ± 25μm, negative on the alignment.</li>
  <li> The printing origin can not remain the same place. Three different results have been received by using same printing origin and same printing setting(voltage, temperature and nozzle to used). The three results are in three different direction relative to printing origin while the nozzle work normally under drop watcher.</li>
</ul>

## Further Improvement
<ul>
  <li><b>Flip Chip Bonding</b>: The pillars on mockup might help block leakage. Use flip chip bonding for better attachment. It might still leak as the pillar is not very tall(maybe hundred nanometer.)</li>
  <li><b>Silver Bumps</b>: The modified process is shown in Fig 3.</li>
  <li><b>Change Ink Viscosity</b>: Change a higher viscosity ink or mixed current ink with polymer ink.</li>
</ul>
