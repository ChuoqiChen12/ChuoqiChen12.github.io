### The Neuron Doctrine
#### Nissl Strain, Nissle bodies 尼氏体
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Nissle bodies are discrete granular structures(颗粒结构) in neurons that consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum(内质网), a collection of parallel, membrane-bound cisternae(膜结合池) studded with ribosomes(散布着核糖体) on the cystosolic surface(细胞质表面) of the membranes(膜).</p> </li>
	<li> <p align="justify">"Nissl stains"(尼氏染色) refers to various basic dyes(染料) that selectively label negatively charged molecules such as DNA and RNA. </p></li>
	<li> <p align="justify">Advantage:  1. distinguishes between neurons and glia; 2. enable histologists to study the arrangement  or cytoarchitecture('cyto' -- Greek 'cell') of neurons in different parts of the brain. </p></li>
	<li> Could not tell the whole stody.</li>

### The Movement of Ions
<ul>
  <li> Diffusion: concentration gradient+membrane has  channels permeable to the ions. </li>
  <li> Electricity: conductance: if  conductance is zero, there will be no current.</li>
</ul>

### The Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential 
<ul>
  <li> $V_m$: Membrane potential(neuronal membrane at any moment).</li>
  <li> microelectrode: thin glass tube with an extremely fine tip.</li>
</ul>

## Chapter 4 The Action Potential
### Properties of the action potential
#### The Ups and Downs of an Action Potential
<ul>
  <li> rising phase, overshoot </li>
  <li> falling phase, undershot/after-hyperpolarization </li>
</ul>

<p align = "center">
<img src = "/assets/img/post/2022-07-20-notes-neuroscience/4-1_Action_Potential.jpg">
</p>
<p align = "center">
Fig.4.1 - Action Potential<a href = "https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/37969" target="_blank">[link]</a>
</p>

#### The Generation of an Action 
<ul>
  <li> Methods of recording action potential</li>
    <ul>
      <li> intracellular -- smaller size</li>
      <li> extracellular</li>
    </ul>
  <li> Process </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Simulate </li>
      <li> The membrane of the nerve fibers is stretched </li>
      <li> Na+ permeable channels open </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### The Action Potential, In Theory
<ul>
  <li> There are three types of protein molecules: sodium-potassium pumps, sodium pumps, potassium pumps</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Driving Force is equal to the real membrane potential and the equilibrium potential, which can be written as Vm-Ek(Vm is the membrane potential, Ek is the potential inside)</p></li>
  <li> $I_K=g_K(V_m-E_K)$</li>
  <li> More generally, it is writen as $I_{ion} = g{ion}(V_m-E{ion})$</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">At rest: $g_K > g_{Na}$ <br> Ins: $g_{Na} >> g_K$(risingg edge) -- inward sodium current <br> Outs: $g_K >> g_{Na}$(falling edge) -- outward potassium current <br> Simply,switching the dominant membrane permeability from K to Na, the potential could be reversed rapidly.</p></li>
</ul>

### The Action Potential, In Reality
Difficult to measure the sodium and potassium conductance of the membrane -- Breaking techniques: Voltage clamp
#### The Voltage-Gate Sodium Channel
<ul>
  <li><p align="justify">The protein forms a pore in the membrane is highly selective to Na+, and the pore is opened and closed by changes in membrane voltage</p></li>
  <li> Sodium Channel Structure</li>
    <ul>
      <li> polypetide:多肽</li>
      <li> It is for distinct domains numbered Ⅰ- Ⅳ, each domain consists of six transmembrane alpha helices.</li>
      <li> The four domains clump together to form a pore between them</li>
      <li> pore loop are selectivity filter</li>
      <li> S4 is voltage sensor</li>
      <li> the domains may arrange  themselves to form a pore between them</li>
      <li> measurement function : patch clamp 膜片钳</li>
      <li>If the membrane potential does not reach threshold;potential, the change of potential have little effect on it.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

#### Voltage-gated Potassium Channels
<p align="justify">Different from sodium channels, it did not open immediately. There is a delay. It is called delay rectifier 延迟整流器</p>

#### Putting the Pieces Together
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Threshold: Membrane potential at which enough voltage-gated sodium channels open so that the relative ionic permeability of the membrane favor sodiums over potassium.</p></li>
  <li> Rising Phase: Na+ rushed into the cell, causing the membrane to depolarize.</li>
  <li> Overshoot: membrane potential goes closely to $E_{Na}$.</li>
  <li> Falling Phase: sodium channels inactivate. Potassium channels open.</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Undershoot: The open voltage-gated potassium channels add to the resting potassium membrane permeability.</p></li>
  <li> Absolute refractory period: period when the channel inactivate and the channel is about to open.</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Relative refractory period: the membrane potential stay  hyperpolarized until the voltage-gated potassium channels close.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>

### Action Potential Conduction
<ul>
  <li> soma to the axon terminal: orthodromic conduction -- without decrement</li>
  <li> backward propagation(either end of Axon couldd be depolarized)</li>
  <li> Action potential conduction velocities vary. But typically it is 10m/sec</li>
  <li> Influencing factors</li>
    <ul>
      <li> <p align="justify">The Farther the current goes down the axon, the farther ahead of the action potential the membrane will be depolarized, the faster the action potential will propagate; action potential conduction velocity increases with increasing axonal diameter.</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Axonal size and the numbers of voltage-gated channels affect axonal excitability. smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach action potential threshold and are more sensitive to being blocked by local anesthetics.</p></li>
    </ul>
  <li>Myelin  and Saltatory Conduction</li>
    <ul>
      <li> myelin 髓磷脂: wrapping the axon with insulation -- increase action potential conduction.</li>
      <li> There are breaks in the insulation where ions across the membrane to generate action potentials.</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">node of Ramvier(potential skip from node to node) -- this kind of potential is called saltatory conduction.</p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### Action Potential, Axons and dendrites
<ul>
  <li> Dendrites and cell bodies do not generate sodium-dependent action potentials( very few channels).</li>
  <li> The axon hillock is ofter called spike-initiation zone.  occurs near nerve endings.</li>
  <li> Aspinous stellate cells: typically responds to a steady firing rate.</li>
  <li> Spiny pyramidal cells: fire rapidly at the beginning and slow down.</li>
</ul>

## Chapter 5 Synaptic Transmission
Synaptic transmission突触传递: information transfer at a synapse

### Type of synapses
#### Electrical Synapse
<ul>
  <li> Allow direct transfer of ionic current from one cell to the next</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">it occurs at gap junctions (between cells in nearly every part of the body and interconnect many non-neural cells,  some glandular cells 腺细胞 and glia)</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">At a gap junction, there are only 3 nm between the separated cells. The gap is spanned by clusters of special proteins called connexins 连接蛋白</p></li>
  <li> 20 subtypes of commexins -- half occurs in brain</li>
  <li> Six connexin subunits combine to form a channel called connexon</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Two connexons(from each cell)meet and combine to form a gap junction channel -- the channel allows ions to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to the cytoplasm of the other. </p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">The pore of the gap junction is relatively large. -- big enough for all the major cellular ions and many small organic molecules. </p></li>
  <li> Gap junctions allow ionic current to pass equally well in both directions</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Electrical Synapse is bidirectional. Because electrical current can pass through these channels, cells connected by gap junctions are said to be electrically coupled (fast -- enables an animal to beat a hasty retreat when faced with a dangerous situation).</p>  </li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Postsynaptic potential(PSP)突触后电位 : when two neurons causes a small amount of ionic current to flow across the gap junction channels into the other neuron. This current causes an electrically mediated postsynaptic potential.</p></li>
  <li> The precise role of electrical synapse vary.</li>
</ul>

#### Chemical Synapse
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">The pre- and post-synaptic membrane at chemical synapses are separated by a synaptic cleft裂缝. The cleft is filled with a matrix基质 of fibrous extracellular protein纤维细胞外蛋白.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Many axon terminals contain larger vesicles囊泡.(Secretory Granules分泌颗粒; Dense-core Vesicles致密核心囊泡)</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Dense accumulation of protein adjacent to and within the membranes on either side of the synaptic cleft are collectively called membrane differentiations. On the pre-side, it looks like pyramid. The pyramids and the membrane associated with them are the actual sites of neurotransmitter release, called active zones.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Postsynaptic density: the protein thickly accumulated in and just under the postsynaptic membrane(contains the neurotransmitter receptors, which convert the intercellular chemical signal into an intercellular signal).</p></li>
</ul>

#### CNS Chemical Synapses
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Asymmetrical synapse/Gray's type Ⅰ synapses: postsynaptic side is thicker than that on the presyunaptic side(excitatory兴奋的)</p></li>
  <li> Symmetrical synapse//Gray's type Ⅱ synapses: similar thickness(inhibitory抑制性)</li>
</ul>

#### Neuromuscular junction
<ul>
  <li> Chemical synapse also occur between the axons of motor neurons of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle </li>
  <li> Fast and reliable.</li>
</ul>

### Principles of Chemical Synaptic transmission
#### Neurotransmitters
<ul>
  <li> amino acides</li>
    <ul>
      <li> small organic molecules</li>
      <li> store in and release from synaptic vesicles</li>
    </ul>
  <li> amines</li>
    <ul>
      <li> small organic molecules</li>
      <li> store in and release from synaptic vesicles</li>
    </ul>
  <li> peptides</li>
    <ul>
      <li> large molecules</li>
      <li> store and release from secretory granules</li>
    </ul>
  <li> Different neurons in the brain release different neurotransmitters</li>
</ul>

#### Neurotransmitter Synthesis and Storage
<ul>
  <li> Different neurotransmitters are synthesized in different way</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">The synthesizing enzymes for both amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are transported to the axon terminal, where they are locally and rapidly direct transmitter synthesis</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Once synthesized, the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters must be taken up by the synaptic vesicles (transporters)</p></li>
</ul>

#### Neurotransmitter Release
<ul>
  <li>Release is triggered by the arrive of an action potential</li>
  <li>The depolarization of the terminal membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channels</li>
  <li><p align="justify">Exocytosis: the vesicles release their contents. The membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses to the presynaptic membrane at the active zone, allowing the contents of the vesicle to spill out into the synaptic cleft.</p></li>
</ul>

#### Neurotransmitter Receptors and Effectors
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Membrane-spanning proteins consisting of four or five subunits that come together to form a pore between them.</p></li>
  <li> Same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions.</li>
  <li> <p align="justify">EPSP(excitatory postsynaptic potential): a transient postsynaptic membrane depolarization caused by excitatory. Synaptic activation os ACh-gated and glutamate-gated ion channels causes EPSPs.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Inhibitory postsynaptic potential(IPSP): an transient hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane potential caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter.</p></li>
  <li> G-Protein-Coupled Receptors</li>
    <ul>
      <li> All three types of transmitter all act on this.</li>
      <li> Reptor poteins embeded in the postsynaptic membrane.</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">The receptor proteins activate small proteins, called G-proteins(free to move along intracellular face of the postsynaptic membrane)</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">The activated G-protein activate "effector" proteins -- Second Messengers(it can activate additional enzymers in cytosol.)</p></li>
    </ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Presynaptic receptors that are sensitive to the neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic terminal.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Autoreceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that stimulate second messenger formation.</p></li>
</ul>

#### Neurotransmitter Recovery and Degradation
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Once the neurotransmitter has interated, it must be cleared from the synaptic cleft to allow another roung of synaptic transmission.</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li> Simple diffusion (occurs by the action of specific neurotransmitter transport protein)</li>
      <li> Enzymatic detraction in the synaptic cleft(ACh)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

#### Neuropharmacology
the study of drugs on nervous system

### Principle of Synaptic Integration
#### The Integration of EPSPs
<ul>
  <li> Quantal Analysis of EPSPs</li>
    <ul>
      <li> <p align="justify">EPSP is some multiple of the response to the contents of a single vesicle(the total amount of transmitter released is some multiple of the contents of a single synaptic vesicle)</p></li>
      <li> Miniature Postsynaptic Potential: generated by the trasmitter contents of one vesicle</li>
    </ul>
  <li> EPSP Summation</li>
    <ul>
      <li> EPSP Summation: represents the simplest form of synaptic integration in the CNS</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Spatial Summation: adding together of EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Temporal Summation: adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succeesion</p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

#### The Contribution of Dentritic Properties to Synaptic Integration
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse in triggering an action potential depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone and ont the properties of the dendritic membrane</p></li>
  <li> Dendritic Cable Properties</li>
    <ul>
      <li> length constant: $V_{\lambda}=0.37(V_o)$</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">The length constant is an index of how far deporization can psread down a dendrite or axon</p></li>
      <li> Decrease in the end</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Internal resistance: the resistance to current flowing longitudinally down the dendrite (depends on the diameter of the dendrite and the elctrical properties of the cytoplasm -- relatively a constant)</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Membrane resistance: the resistance to current flowing across the membrane (depends on the number of open ion channels, which changes from moment to moment depending on what other synapses are active)</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Excitable dendrites: The dendrites's membrane is electrically passive, lacks voltage-gated channels.</p></li>
    </ul>
  <li> Inhibition</li>
    <ul>
      <li> IPSPs and shunting Inhibition</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <p align="justify">The only important differences are that they different neurotransmitters and allow different ions to pass through their channels</p></li>
          <li> <p align="justify">Shunting  inhibition: synapse acts as ame electrical shunt, preventing the current from flowing through the soma to he axon hillock (reduce the size of EPSPs, making the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fire actioin potentials)</p></li>
        </ul>
      <li> The Geometry of excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses</li>
        <ul>
          <li><p align="justify">Inhibitory synapses use GABA or glycine as a neurotransmitter have a morphology charateristic of Gray's type Ⅱ -- contrasts with excitatory synapses that sue glutamate which have a Gray's type Ⅰ morphology.</p></li>
          <li><p align="justify">Inhibitory synapses on many neurons are foudn clustered on the soma and near the axon hillock (powerful position to influence the activity of the postsynaptic neuron)</p></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

#### Modulation
<ul>
  <li><p align="justify">many synapses with G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not directly associated with an ion channel (insteead modifies the effectiveness of EPSPs generated by other synapses with transmitter-gated channels)</p></li>
  <li> The norepinephrine beta receptor去甲肾上腺素β受体</li>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="justify"> Neurotransmitter norepinephrine(NE) to the βreceptor triggers a cascade of biochemical events within the cell -- activate a G-protein/ an effector protein, the intracellular细胞内的 enzyme adenylyl cyclase腺苷酸环化酶</p></li>
      <li><p align="justify"> Adenylyl cyclase 腺苷酸环化酶 catalyzes the chemical reaction that converts ATP. Its product of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria 线粒体 into a compund called cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) 环磷酸腺苷</p></li>
      <li><p align="justify"> The effect of cAMP is to stimulate another enzyme know as a protein kinase蛋白激酶, which catalyze a chemical reaction called phosphorylation 磷酸化</p></li>
      <li><p align="justify"> Decreasing the K+ conductance increases the dendritic membrane resistance and therefor increases the length constant -- distant or week excitatory synapses will become more effective in depolarization the spike -initiation zone beyond threshold; cell become more excitable</p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</ul>

#### Cholinergic Neuron 胆碱能神经元
<ul>
  <li><p align="justify"> Acetylcholine(ACh)乙酰胆碱 is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and is therefore synthesized by all the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem.</p> </li>

#### Pumping Ions and Transmitters
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">The hard job of transporters is to pump transmitter molecules across membrane so effectively(concentrate in very small places)</p> </li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Membranes of synaptic vesicles have pumps that us ATP to fuel the transport of $H^+$ into vesicles.</p> </li>

</ul>

#### Other Neurotransmitter Candidates and Intercellular Messengers
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Adenosine Triphosphate(ATP) is also a neurotransmitter. It is concentrated in all synaptic vesicles in the CNS and PNS, and it is released into the cleft by presynaptic spiles in a $Ca^{2+}$ dependent manner.</p> </li>
  <li> Endocannabinoids 内源性大麻素</li>
    <ul>
      <li> <p align="justify">They are not packaged in vesicles like most other neurotransmitters, instead, they are manufactured rapidly and on demand.</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">They are small and membrane permeable; once synthesized,, they can diffuse rapidly across the membrane of their cell of origin to contact neighboring cells.</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">hey bind selectively to the CB1 types of cannabinoid receptor, which is mainly located on certain presynaptic terminals.</p></li>
      <li> <p align="justify">When a postsynaptic neuron is very active, it releases enndocannabinoids, which suppress wither the inhibitory or excitatory drive onto the neurons.</p></li>

#### The Basic Structure of Transmitter-Gated Channels
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">Most contain the four hydrophobic segments that span the membrane in subunits of the nicotinic ACh recptor, the GABA_A receptor, and the glycine recepter. These three receptors are all pentameric complexes of subunits.</p></li>

</p>

#### Amino Acid-Gated Channels
<ul>
  <li> Amino acid-gated channels mediate most of the fast synaptic transmission in the CNS.</li>
  <li> Several Propoerties of there channels distinguish them from one another:</li>
    <ul>
      <li> <p align="justify">The <i>pharmacology</i> of their binding sites decribes which transmitters affect them and how drug interact with them.</p></li>

      <li> The <i>conductance</i> of open channels helps determine the magnitude of their effects.</li>
    </ul>
  <li> Glutamated-Gated Channels </li>
</ul>

| glutamate receptor subtypes |  AMPA | NMDA | Kainate|
|-----------------------------|-------|------|--------|
| Ion permeable               | $Na^+,K^+$ | $Ca^{2+}$ |  $Na^+,K^+$(slower) |
| Potential                   | active at normal negative membrane | voltage dependent(when AMPA at the same and neighboring synapse) | ? |
| Function | mediate excitoatory transmission in much the same way <br>as nicotinic receptors mediate synaptic excitation at neuromuscular juncion |  Cause widespread and lasting changes in the postsynaptic neuron.  | more than just an ionotropic |

<ul>
  <li> GABA-Gated and Glycine-Gated Channels </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> GABA mediates most synaptic inhiition in CNS, and glycine mediates most of the rest.</li>
      <li> <p align="justify">Synaptic inhibition must be tightly regulated in the brain. Too much causes a loss of consciousness and coma; too little leads to a seizure.</p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### G-Protein-Coupled Receptors And Effectors
<ul>
  <li> There are multiple subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors in every known neurotransmitter system. </li>
  <li> Transmission at these receptors involves three steps: (1) binding of the neurotransmitter to the receptor protein, (2) activation of G-proteins, and (3) activation os effector systems.</li>
</ul>

#### The Basic Structure of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors
<ul>
  <li> Most receptors consists of a single polypeptide containing seven membrane-spanning alpha helices. </li>
  <li> Two of the extracellular loops of the polypeptide form the transmitter binding sites. </li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Structural variations in thie region determine which neurotransmitters, agonists, and antagonists bind to the receptor, sonsequently. which effector systems are activated in response to transmitter binding.</p></li>
</ul>

Fig 6.3 - Similarities in the structure of subunit for different transmitter-gated ion channels<a href = "http://medcraveonline.com/JSRT/JSRT-02-00065.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>
</p>

#### The Uniquitous G-Proteins
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">There are many more transmitter receptors than G-protein , so many types of G-proteins can be activated by many receptors.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">Each G-protein has three subunits, termed $\alpha \ \ beta \ \ gamma$. In the resting state, a guanosine diphosphate(GDP) molecule is bound to the $G_{\alpha}$ sub-unit, and the whole complex floats around on the inner surface of the membrane.</p> </li>
  <li> <p align="justify">If this GDP-bound G-protein bumps into the proper type of receptor and if thaat receptor has a transmitter molecule bound to it, then the g-protein releases its GDP and exchanges it for a GTP that it picks up from the cytosol.</p> </li>
  <li> <p align="justify">The activated GTP-bound G-protein splits into two parts: the $G_{\alpha}$ subunit puls GTP and the $G_{\beta \gamma}$ complex. Both can then move on the influence various effector proteins.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">The $G_{\alpha}$ subunit is itself an enzyme that eventually breaks down GTP into GDP. Therefore, $G_{\alpha}$ eventually terminates its own activity by converting the bound GTP to GDP.</p></li>
  <li> <p align="justify">The $G_{\alpha}$ and $G_{\beta \gamma}$ subunits come back together, allowing the cycle to begin again.</p></li>
</ul>

#### G-Protein-Coupled Effector Systems
<ul>
  <li> <p align="justify">The activated G-proteins exert their effects by binding to either of two types of effector proteins: G-protein-gated ion channels and G-protein-activated enzymes.</p></li>
  <li> A variety of neurotransmitters use the short-cut pathway, from receptor to G-protein to ion channel. One example is the muscarinic receptors in the heart.</li>
  <li> Shortcut pathways are the fastest of the G-protein-coupled systems, having responses beginning within 300-100 msec of neurotransmitter bind.</li>
  <li>The shortcut pathway is also very localized compared with other effector systems. Beacuase all the action in the shortcut pathway occurs within the membrane, it is sometimes called the <b> membrane-delimited pathway</b></li>
  <li> G-proteins can also exert their effects by directly activating certain enzymes(<b>second messenger cascade</b>). Activation of these enzymes can trigger an elaborate series of biochemical reactions, a cascade that often ends in the activation of other "downstream" enzymes that alter neuronal funtion. </li>
  <li> synaptic transmission using transmitter-gated channels is simple and fast. Transmission involving G-protein-coupled receptors is complex and slow. </li>
</ul>

</p>

#### Givergenve and Convergence In Neurotransmitter Systems
<ul>
  <li><b>divergence</b>: The abilit of one transmitter to activate more than one type of postsynaptic response. </li>
  <li> Divergence is the rule among neurotransmitter systes,.Because of the multiple receptor subtypes, one transmitter can affect different neurons in very different ways.</li>
  <li> Divergence may occur at any stage in the cascade of transmitter effects. </li>
  <li> Neurotransmitters can also exhibit convergence of effects. Multiple transmitters, each activating their own receptor type, can converge to influence the same effector system.</li>
</ul>

#### Conclusion
<ul>
  <li> Neurotransmitters are the essential links between neurons, and between neurons and other effector cells.</li>
  <li> Transmitters is one link in a chain of events, inciting chemical changes both fast and slow, divergent and convergent.</li>

### Introduction
<ul>
  <li> Nervous system structure is the basis of understanding brain function.</li>
  <li> The human brain appears complicated because it is distorted as a result of the selective growth of some parts within the confines of the skull.</li>
</ul>

### Gross Organization of The Mammalian Nervous System
The nervous system of all mammals has two divisions: the central nervous system(CNS) and the peripheral nervous system(PNS). 

#### Anatomical References

  <li> In the language of anatomists, a lice is called <i>a section</i>; to slice is <i>to section</i></li>
  <li><b> Midsagittal plane</b>: splitting the brain into equal right and left halves</li>
  <li><b> Sagittal plane</b>: Sections parallel to the midsagittal</li>
  <li><b> Horizontal plane</b>: parallel to the ground</li>
  <li><b> Coronal plane</b>: perpendicular to the ground and to the sagittal plane</li>
  <li>The anatomical planes are perpendicular to each other.</li>
</ul>

#### The Central Nervous System
<ul>
  <li> The central nervous system(CNS) consists of the parts of the nervous system that are encases in bond: the brain and the spinal cord.</li>
  <li><b> Cerebrum</b>: the rostral-most and largest part of the brain. The middle plane split down the middle into two cerebral hemispheres, separated by the deep sagittal fissure. In general, the righ cerebral hemisphere receives sensations from, and controls movements of, the left side of the body. Similarly, the left cerebral hemisphere is concerned with sensations and movements on the right side of the body. </li>
  <li><b> Cerebellum</b>: lying behind the cerebrum. The cerebellum is primarily a movement control center that has extensive connections with the cerebrum and the spinal cord. In contrast tp the cerebral hemispheres, the left body and the right side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the right side. </li>
  <li><b> Brain stem</b>: the brain stem forms the stalk from which the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum sprout.The stem is a complex nexus of fivers and cells that relay information from the cerebrum to the spinal cord and cerebellum, and vice versa.</li>
  <li><b> Spinal Cord</b>: the spinal cord is encased in the bony vertebral column and is attached to the brain stem. The spinal cord commmunicates with the body via the spinal nerves(part of the peripehral nervous system) Each spinal nerve attaches to the spinal cord by means of two branches, the  dorsal root and the ventral root.</li>
</ul>

#### The Peripheral Nervous System
<ul>
  <li> All the parts of the nervous system otherthan the brain and spinal cord comprise the peripheral nervous system(PNS). The PNS has two parts: the somatic PNS and the visceral PNS.</li>
  <li><b> The Somatic PNS</b>: all the spinal nerves that innervate the skin, the joints, and the muscles that are under voluntary contraol are part of the somatic PNS. The somatic sensory axons(innervate and collects information from the skin, muscles, and joints) enter the sinal cord via the dorsal roots. The cell bodies of these neurons lie outside the spinal cord in clusters called <b> dorsal root ganglia</b>. </li>
  <li><b> The Visceral PNS(Autonomic nervous system ANS)</b>: consists of the neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels and glands. When one speaks of an emotional reaction that is beyond voluntary control(butterflies in the stomach), it usually is mediated by the visceral PNS. </li>
  <li><b>Afferent and Efferent Axons </b>: indicate whether the axons are transporting information toward or away from a particular point. </li>
</ul>

#### The Cranial Nerves
<ul>
  <li> There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that arise from the brain stem and innervate the head. </li>
  <li> Some of the cranial nerves are part of the CNS/somatic PNS/visceral PNS.</li>
</ul>

#### The Meninges
<ul>
  <li> The CNS is protected by thress membrane collectively called the <b>meninges</b>. The three membranes are the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater.</li>
  <li><b> Dura mater</b>: the outermost covering, forming a tough, inelastic bag that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.</li>
  <li><b> Arachnoid membrane</b>: lie under the dura mater,  with an appearance and a consistency resembling a spider web. </li>
  <li><b>Subdural hematoma</b>: if the bood vessels passing through the dura are ruptured, blood can collect her and form what is called subdural hematoma. (normally no space between)<li>
  <li><b>Pia mater</b>: a thin membrane that adheres closely to the surface of the brain. Many blood vessels ultimately dive into the substrate of the underlying brain along the pia. </li>
  <li><b>Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF)</b>: the pia is separated from the arachnoid by a fluid-filled space.</li>
</ul>
