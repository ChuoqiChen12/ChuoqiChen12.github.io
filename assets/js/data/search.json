Neuroscience: A Historical Introduction Chapter 2 Neurons and GliaIntroduction Obstacles Small size uniform, cream-colored appearance under microscope The Neuron DoctrineNissl Strain, Nissle bodies 尼氏体 Nissle bodies are discrete granular structures(颗粒结构) in neurons that consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum(内质网), a collection of parallel, membrane-bound cisternae(膜结合池) studded with ribosomes(散布着核糖体) on the cystosolic surface(细胞质表面) of the membranes(膜). \t \"Nissl stains\"(尼氏染色) refers to various basic dyes(染料) that selectively label negatively charged molecules such as DNA and RNA. \t Advantage: 1. distinguishes between neurons and glia; 2. enable histologists to study the arrangement or cytoarchitecture('cyto' -- Greek 'cell') of neurons in different parts of the brain. \t Could not tell the whole stody.Fig.2.1 - Photomicrograph of Nissl bodies[wiki]The Golgi Stain 高尔基染色 show neurons have at least two parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region The swollen region(肿) contains cell body soma(plural: somata) 躯体 perikaryon(plural: perikarya) 周核体 The thin tubes neurites 神经突: Axibs 轴突 and dendrites 树突 The cell body usually gives rise to a single axon(轴突). The axon is of uniform diameter throughout its length and any branches from it generally extend at right angles -- Axons can extend over great distances in the body. The Prototypical NeuronThe Soma 躯体 Spherical central part Cytosol 胞质溶胶: watery fluid inside the cell; salty, potassium-rich solution; separated from outside by neuronal membrane organelles 细胞器: membrane-enclosed structures The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles found in all animal cells. Everything contained within the confines of the cell membrane, including the organelles but excluding the nucleus, is referred to collectively as the cytoplasm 细胞质 Nucleus 细胞核 Latin 'nut',spherical, central located, 5-10 μm nuclear envelope 核膜: Double membrane 0.1μm Chromosomes, DNA, Gene Gene expression: Reading, final product is the synthesis of molecules(Proteins) occur in aytoplasm It is performed by messenger ribonucleic acide/mRNA, the process called transcription 转录(the part of DNA called transcript)(RNA polymerase RNA聚合酶) （Promoter, exon, intron, terminator, transcription factor, RNA slicing RNA剪接) translation (protein building blocks: amino acide 氨基酸) Neuronal Genes, Genetic Variation and Genetic Engineering Neurons differ from other cells in the body because of the specific genes they express as proteins mishaps不幸: gene copy number variations(occur when paternal and maternal DNA mix to create the genome基因组 of the offspring后代); mutation(single nucleotide polymorphisms单核苷酸多态性) knockout mice基因敲除小鼠 knock-in mice 敲入小鼠 transgenic mice 转基因 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum 粗面内质网 protein synthesis site in Neurons, free ribosomes(核糖体)， polyribosomes 多核糖体(attach by a thread, a single strand of mRNA) ifference between proteins sythesized on the rough ER and on the free ribosomes: depend on the intended fate of the protein molecule inseted into the membrance of the cell or an organelle : Rough ER cytosol: free ribosomes Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum 滑面内质网 and The Golbi Apparatus 高尔基体 without ribosomes heterogeneous and perform different function in different locations continuous with Rough ER Golbi apparatus: sorting of certain proteins that are destined for delivery to different parts of the neuron The mitochondrion 线粒体 cristae 嵴 matrix 嵴内间隙 cell respiration 细胞呼吸 Krebs cycle(electron-transport chain) : ADP, ATP cell's energy source The neuronal Membrane barrier 5nm, stubbed with protein associated with pump substance Membrane difference mainly in proteins compositionsThe cytoskeleton 细胞骨架 it gives neuron its characteristic shape microtubes a straight, thick-wall hollow pipe the wall of the pipe consists of the protein tubulin 微管蛋白 Polymerization 聚合: joining small proteins to form a long strand microtubule-associated proteins MAPs: participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly(connect wit other parts of the neuron) Pathological changes 病理变化 in an axonal MAP called tau has been implicated in the dementia失智 that accompanies Alzheimer's decease microfilaments 微丝: braids of two thin strands that are polymers of the protein actin肌动蛋白 Neurofilaments 神经丝 as intermediate dilaments most closely resemble bones and ligaments of the skeleton The Axon highly specialized for the transfer of information Axon hillock 轴突丘: begin region No rough ER extends into the axon, and there are few, if any,free ribosomes in the mature axons The protein composition is different from soma membrance All protein in the axonal membrance originate from soma -- enable axonal membrance serve as a wire that sends information over great distance Axon collaterals轴突侧支; recurrent collaterals axon diameter varies: nerve impluses depends on the axonal diameter.

Electricity: conductance: if conductance is zero, there will be no current.The Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential $V_m$: Membrane potential(neuronal membrane at any moment). microelectrode: thin glass tube with an extremely fine tip.Equilibrium potentials Ionic equilibrium potential: the electrical potential difference that exactly balance an ionic concentration gradient. Large changes in membrane potential are caused by minuscule changes in ionic concentration. The net difference in electrical charge occurs at the inside and outside surfaces of the membrane. Ion are driven across the membrane at a rate proportional to the difference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential.The distribution of Ions Across the Membrane Sodium-postassium pump: enzyme that breaks down ATP in the presence of internal Na+; chemical energy released by this reaction drives the pump -- exchange internal Na+ for external K+; requires metabolic energy -- spends as mu as 70% of the total amount of ATP utilized by the brain. Calcium pump: enzyme that transports Ca2+ The Relative Ion Permeabilities of the Membrane at Rest Goldman Equation: $V_m=61.54 \\ mV \\ log\\frac{P_K[K^+]_O+P_{Na}[Na^+]_O}{P_K[K^+]_O+P_{Na}[Na^+]_O}$ Potassium Channels 钾通道: There is a large K+ concentration gradient across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the membrane can be thought of as a battery whose charge is maintained by the work of the ion pumps. Chapter 4 The Action PotentialProperties of the action potentialThe Ups and Downs of an Action Potential rising phase, overshoot falling phase, undershot/after-hyperpolarization Fig.4.1 - Action Potential[link]The Generation of an Action Methods of recording action potential intracellular -- smaller size extracellular Process Simulate The membrane of the nerve fibers is stretched Na+ permeable channels open The Action Potential, In Theory There are three types of protein molecules: sodium-potassium pumps, sodium pumps, potassium pumps Driving Force is equal to the real membrane potential and the equilibrium potential, which can be written as Vm-Ek(Vm is the membrane potential, Ek is the potential inside) $I_K=g_K(V_m-E_K)$ More generally, it is writen as $I_{ion} = g{ion}(V_m-E{ion})$ At rest: $g_K &gt; g_{Na}$ Ins: $g_{Na} &gt;&gt; g_K$(risingg edge) -- inward sodium current Outs: $g_K &gt;&gt; g_{Na}$(falling edge) -- outward potassium current Simply,switching the dominant membrane permeability from K to Na, the potential could be reversed rapidly.The Action Potential, In RealityDifficult to measure the sodium and potassium conductance of the membrane – Breaking techniques: Voltage clampThe Voltage-Gate Sodium Channel The protein forms a pore in the membrane is highly selective to Na+, and the pore is opened and closed by changes in membrane voltage Sodium Channel Structure polypetide:多肽 It is for distinct domains numbered Ⅰ- Ⅳ, each domain consists of six transmembrane alpha helices. The four domains clump together to form a pore between them pore loop are selectivity filter S4 is voltage sensor the domains may arrange themselves to form a pore between them measurement function : patch clamp 膜片钳 If the membrane potential does not reach threshold;potential, the change of potential have little effect on it. Voltage-gated Potassium ChannelsDifferent from sodium channels, it did not open immediately. There is a delay. It is called delay rectifier 延迟整流器Putting the Pieces Together Threshold: Membrane potential at which enough voltage-gated sodium channels open so that the relative ionic permeability of the membrane favor sodiums over potassium. Rising Phase: Na+ rushed into the cell, causing the membrane to depolarize. Overshoot: membrane potential goes closely to $E_{Na}$. Falling Phase: sodium channels inactivate. Potassium channels open. Undershoot: The open voltage-gated potassium channels add to the resting potassium membrane permeability. Absolute refractory period: period when the channel inactivate and the channel is about to open. Relative refractory period: the membrane potential stay hyperpolarized until the voltage-gated potassium channels close.Fig.4.2 - Molecular basis of the action potential[link]Action Potential Conduction soma to the axon terminal: orthodromic conduction -- without decrement backward propagation(either end of Axon couldd be depolarized) Action potential conduction velocities vary. But typically it is 10m/sec Influencing factors The Farther the current goes down the axon, the farther ahead of the action potential the membrane will be depolarized, the faster the action potential will propagate; action potential conduction velocity increases with increasing axonal diameter. Axonal size and the numbers of voltage-gated channels affect axonal excitability. smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach action potential threshold and are more sensitive to being blocked by local anesthetics. Myelin and Saltatory Conduction myelin 髓磷脂: wrapping the axon with insulation -- increase action potential conduction. There are breaks in the insulation where ions across the membrane to generate action potentials. node of Ramvier(potential skip from node to node) -- this kind of potential is called saltatory conduction. Action Potential, Axons and dendrites Dendrites and cell bodies do not generate sodium-dependent action potentials( very few channels). The axon hillock is ofter called spike-initiation zone. occurs near nerve endings. Aspinous stellate cells: typically responds to a steady firing rate. Spiny pyramidal cells: fire rapidly at the beginning and slow down.Chapter 5 Synaptic TransmissionSynaptic transmission突触传递: information transfer at a synapseType of synapsesElectrical Synapse Allow direct transfer of ionic current from one cell to the next it occurs at gap junctions (between cells in nearly every part of the body and interconnect many non-neural cells, some glandular cells 腺细胞 and glia) At a gap junction, there are only 3 nm between the separated cells. The gap is spanned by clusters of special proteins called connexins 连接蛋白 20 subtypes of commexins -- half occurs in brain Six connexin subunits combine to form a channel called connexon Two connexons(from each cell)meet and combine to form a gap junction channel -- the channel allows ions to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to the cytoplasm of the other. The pore of the gap junction is relatively large. -- big enough for all the major cellular ions and many small organic molecules. Gap junctions allow ionic current to pass equally well in both directions Electrical Synapse is bidirectional. Because electrical current can pass through these channels, cells connected by gap junctions are said to be electrically coupled (fast -- enables an animal to beat a hasty retreat when faced with a dangerous situation). Postsynaptic potential(PSP)突触后电位 : when two neurons causes a small amount of ionic current to flow across the gap junction channels into the other neuron. This current causes an electrically mediated postsynaptic potential. The precise role of electrical synapse vary.Chemical Synapse The pre- and post-synaptic membrane at chemical synapses are separated by a synaptic cleft裂缝. The cleft is filled with a matrix基质 of fibrous extracellular protein纤维细胞外蛋白. Many axon terminals contain larger vesicles囊泡.(Secretory Granules分泌颗粒; Dense-core Vesicles致密核心囊泡) Dense accumulation of protein adjacent to and within the membranes on either side of the synaptic cleft are collectively called membrane differentiations. On the pre-side, it looks like pyramid. The pyramids and the membrane associated with them are the actual sites of neurotransmitter release, called active zones. Postsynaptic density: the protein thickly accumulated in and just under the postsynaptic membrane(contains the neurotransmitter receptors, which convert the intercellular chemical signal into an intercellular signal).CNS Chemical Synapses Asymmetrical synapse/Gray's type Ⅰ synapses: postsynaptic side is thicker than that on the presyunaptic side(excitatory兴奋的) Symmetrical synapse//Gray's type Ⅱ synapses: similar thickness(inhibitory抑制性)Neuromuscular junction Chemical synapse also occur between the axons of motor neurons of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle Fast and reliable.Principles of Chemical Synaptic transmissionNeurotransmitters amino acides small organic molecules store in and release from synaptic vesicles amines small organic molecules store in and release from synaptic vesicles peptides large molecules store and release from secretory granules Different neurons in the brain release different neurotransmittersNeurotransmitter Synthesis and Storage Different neurotransmitters are synthesized in different way The synthesizing enzymes for both amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are transported to the axon terminal, where they are locally and rapidly direct transmitter synthesis Once synthesized, the amino acid and amine neurotransmitters must be taken up by the synaptic vesicles (transporters)Neurotransmitter Release Release is triggered by the arrive of an action potential The depolarization of the terminal membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channels Exocytosis: the vesicles release their contents. The membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses to the presynaptic membrane at the active zone, allowing the contents of the vesicle to spill out into the synaptic cleft.Neurotransmitter Receptors and Effectors Membrane-spanning proteins consisting of four or five subunits that come together to form a pore between them. Same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions. EPSP(excitatory postsynaptic potential): a transient postsynaptic membrane depolarization caused by excitatory. Synaptic activation os ACh-gated and glutamate-gated ion channels causes EPSPs. Inhibitory postsynaptic potential(IPSP): an transient hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane potential caused by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors All three types of transmitter all act on this. Reptor poteins embeded in the postsynaptic membrane. The receptor proteins activate small proteins, called G-proteins(free to move along intracellular face of the postsynaptic membrane) The activated G-protein activate \"effector\" proteins -- Second Messengers(it can activate additional enzymers in cytosol.) Presynaptic receptors that are sensitive to the neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic terminal. Autoreceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that stimulate second messenger formation.Neurotransmitter Recovery and Degradation Once the neurotransmitter has interated, it must be cleared from the synaptic cleft to allow another roung of synaptic transmission. Simple diffusion (occurs by the action of specific neurotransmitter transport protein) Enzymatic detraction in the synaptic cleft(ACh) Neuropharmacologythe study of drugs on nervous systemPrinciple of Synaptic IntegrationThe Integration of EPSPs Quantal Analysis of EPSPs EPSP is some multiple of the response to the contents of a single vesicle(the total amount of transmitter released is some multiple of the contents of a single synaptic vesicle) Miniature Postsynaptic Potential: generated by the trasmitter contents of one vesicle EPSP Summation EPSP Summation: represents the simplest form of synaptic integration in the CNS Spatial Summation: adding together of EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite Temporal Summation: adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succeesion The Contribution of Dentritic Properties to Synaptic Integration The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse in triggering an action potential depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone and ont the properties of the dendritic membrane Dendritic Cable Properties length constant: $V_{\\lambda}=0.37(V_o)$ The length constant is an index of how far deporization can psread down a dendrite or axon Decrease in the end Internal resistance: the resistance to current flowing longitudinally down the dendrite (depends on the diameter of the dendrite and the elctrical properties of the cytoplasm -- relatively a constant) Membrane resistance: the resistance to current flowing across the membrane (depends on the number of open ion channels, which changes from moment to moment depending on what other synapses are active) Excitable dendrites: The dendrites's membrane is electrically passive, lacks voltage-gated channels. Inhibition IPSPs and shunting Inhibition The only important differences are that they different neurotransmitters and allow different ions to pass through their channels Shunting inhibition: synapse acts as ame electrical shunt, preventing the current from flowing through the soma to he axon hillock (reduce the size of EPSPs, making the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fire actioin potentials) The Geometry of excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses Inhibitory synapses use GABA or glycine as a neurotransmitter have a morphology charateristic of Gray's type Ⅱ -- contrasts with excitatory synapses that sue glutamate which have a Gray's type Ⅰ morphology. Inhibitory synapses on many neurons are foudn clustered on the soma and near the axon hillock (powerful position to influence the activity of the postsynaptic neuron) Modulation many synapses with G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not directly associated with an ion channel (insteead modifies the effectiveness of EPSPs generated by other synapses with transmitter-gated channels) The norepinephrine beta receptor去甲肾上腺素β受体 Neurotransmitter norepinephrine(NE) to the βreceptor triggers a cascade of biochemical events within the cell -- activate a G-protein/ an effector protein, the intracellular细胞内的 enzyme adenylyl cyclase腺苷酸环化酶 Adenylyl cyclase 腺苷酸环化酶 catalyzes the chemical reaction that converts ATP. Its product of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria 线粒体 into a compund called cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) 环磷酸腺苷 The effect of cAMP is to stimulate another enzyme know as a protein kinase蛋白激酶, which catalyze a chemical reaction called phosphorylation 磷酸化 Decreasing the K+ conductance increases the dendritic membrane resistance and therefor increases the length constant -- distant or week excitatory synapses will become more effective in depolarization the spike -initiation zone beyond threshold; cell become more excitable Chapter 6 Neurotransmitter SystemsStudying Neurotransmitter SystemsIdentifying the neurotransmitter: the molecule must be synthesized and stored in the presynaptic neuron The molecule must be released by the pesynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation The molecule must produce a response in the postsynaptic cell that mimics the response produced by the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron. Localization of transmitters and transmitter-synthesizing enzymes Immunocytochemistry 免疫细胞化学: when the same techniques applied to the brain, it is often referred as immunohistochemistry Neurotransmitter candidate has been chemically purified Injected to the skin and blood stream Stimulate an immune response generation of a larger protein: antibodies (the best antibodies for immunocytochemistry bind very tightly to the transmitter of interest and bind very little or not at all to other chemicals in the brain) These antibody could be recovered and tagged with colorful maker.&lt;/p&gt; By using different antibodies, each labeled with a different marker color. It is possible to distinguish several types of cells in the same region of the brain. It can be used to localize any molecule for which a specific antibody can be generated In Situ Hybridization 原位杂交 Process label appropriate probe --complementary strand apply it to a section of brain tissue wait wash away all the extra probes that have not stuck search for the label Chemically tagged radioactive &amp; digital electronic image devices(autoradiography) label the probes with brightly colorful fluorescent molecules (FISH) It can be used to view the location of specific molecules Studying Transmitter Release Impossible to stimulate a single population of synapses containing only a single neurotransmitter use brain slice that are kept in vitro 体外保存 optogenetics -- activate one type of synaptic at one time We still not sure if molecules collected in the fluids were released from the axon terminals Studying Synaptic Mimicry 突触模拟 microiontophoresis 微离子电渗疗法: to assess the postsynaptic actions of a transmitter candidate Process a glass pipette 移液器 with a very fine tip, is filled with the ionized solution the tip is carefully placed next to the postsynaptic membrane of the neuron the transmitter candidate is ejected in a very small amounts by passing electrical current through the pipette a microelectrode in the postsynaptic neuron can be used to measure the effects of the transmitter candidate on the membrane potential If iontophoretic or pressure application 分子的离子电渗或压力应用 of the molecule causes electrophysiological changes 电生理变化 that mimic the effects of transmitter released at the synapse, and if the other criteria of localization, synthesis, and release are met, then the molecule and the transmitter are usually considered to be the same chemical.Receptors rule: no two neurotransmitter can bind to the same receptor. but one neurotransmitter can bind to many receptor neuropharmacological analysis of synaptic transmission two receptor could be distinguish by different drugs (different response) [nicotine ACh receptors &amp; muscarinic ACh receptors] use selective antagonists 选择性拮抗剂 [curane inhibits the action of ACh at nicotinic receptors] Different drugs are also used to distinguish several types of glutamate receptors 谷氨酸受体 [AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, kainate receptors -- is activated selectively by a different agonist 激动剂] Ligand-binding methods many drugs interact selectively with receptors [Opiates, endorphins] Ligand 配体 for that receptors: And chemical compound that binds to a specific site on a receptor A ligand can be a agonist, an antagonistm or the chemical neurotransmitter itself molecular analysis of receptor proteins two groups of neurotransmitter receptor proteins: transmitter-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled(metabotropic) receptors [GABA_A receptor have five subunits and give five major classes of subunit proteins,six different polypeptides] Neurotransmitter Chemistry Dale's Principle: A neuron has only one neurotransmitter Co-transmitters: when two or more transmitters are released from one nerve terminal Cholinergic Neuron 胆碱能神经元 Acetylcholine(ACh)乙酰胆碱 is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and is therefore synthesized by all the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Its synthesis requires a specific enzyme, choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) 胆碱乙酰转移酶. ChAT is manufactured in the soma and transported to the axon terminal. Only cholinergic neurons contain ChAT The transport of choline into the neuron is said to be the rate-limiting step in ACh sythesis AChE: Acetylcholinesterase 乙酰胆碱酯酶 Pumping Ions and Transmitters The hard job of transporters is to pump transmitter molecules across membrane so effectively(concentrate in very small places) Membranes of synaptic vesicles have pumps that us ATP to fuel the transport of $H^+$ into vesicles. Transportaers use transmembrane gradient of $Na^+$ or $H^+$ as an energy source for moving transmitter molecules up steep concentration gradients. The transporters themselves are large proteins that span membranes.Several transporters serve as a transmitters. Plasma membrane transporters use a contransport mechanism carrying two $Na^+$ ions along with one transmitter molecule Vesicular membrane transporters use a countertransport mechanism that trades a transmitter molecule from tje cytosol for a $H^+$ that trades a transmitter molecule from the cytosol for a $H^+$ from inside the cesicle. Many psychoactive drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine, potently blocck certain transporters. Fig 6.1 - The life cycle[link]Catecholaminergic Neurons 儿茶酚胺能神经元 neurotransmitters with catechol 儿茶酚 is called catecholamines 儿茶酚胺 The catecholamine neurotransmitters are Dopamine(DA) 多巴胺 , Norepinephrine(NE)去甲肾上腺素 , Epinephrine 肾上腺素/Adrenaline This process have no fast extracellular degradative enzyme analogous to AChE. The process is sensitive to cocaine and monoamine oxidase. Serotonergic Neurons 血清素能神经元 The amine neurotransmitter serotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) The process is sensitive to MAO and antidepressant and antianxietyAmino Acidergic Neurons 氨基酸能神经元 glutamate(Glu), glycine(Gly) and gamma-amino-butyric acid(GABA) 谷氨酸(Glu)、甘氨酸(Gly)和γ-氨基丁酸(GABA) Glutamate and glucine are synthesized from glucose and other precursors Other Neurotransmitter Candidates and Intercellular Messengers Adenosine Triphosphate(ATP) is also a neurotransmitter. It is concentrated in all synaptic vesicles in the CNS and PNS, and it is released into the cleft by presynaptic spiles in a $Ca^{2+}$ dependent manner. Endocannabinoids 内源性大麻素 They are not packaged in vesicles like most other neurotransmitters, instead, they are manufactured rapidly and on demand. They are small and membrane permeable; once synthesized,, they can diffuse rapidly across the membrane of their cell of origin to contact neighboring cells. hey bind selectively to the CB1 types of cannabinoid receptor, which is mainly located on certain presynaptic terminals. When a postsynaptic neuron is very active, it releases enndocannabinoids, which suppress wither the inhibitory or excitatory drive onto the neurons. Nitric oxide(NO) Transmitter-Gated ChannelsA single channel can be a sensitive detector of chemicals and voltage, it can regulate the flow of surprisingly large currents with great precision, it can sift and select between very similar ions and can be regulateed by other receptor systems.(11nm long)The Basic Structure of Transmitter-Gated Channels Most contain the four hydrophobic segments that span the membrane in subunits of the nicotinic ACh recptor, the GABA_A receptor, and the glycine recepter. These three receptors are all pentameric complexes of subunits. The glutamate-gated channels are slightly different. Glutamate receptors are tetramers, having four subunits that comprise a functional channel. Fig 6.2 - Similarities in the structure of subunit for different transmitter-gated ion channels[link]Amino Acid-Gated Channels Amino acid-gated channels mediate most of the fast synaptic transmission in the CNS. Several Propoerties of there channels distinguish them from one another: The pharmacology of their binding sites decribes which transmitters affect them and how drug interact with them. The kinetics of the transmitter binding process and channel gating determine the duration of their effect. Thhe selectivity of the ion channels determines whether they produce excitation or inhibition and whether $Ca^{2+}$ enters the cell in significant amounts. The conductance of open channels helps determine the magnitude of their effects. Glutamated-Gated Channels glutamate receptor subtypes AMPA NMDA Kainate Ion permeable $Na^+,K^+$ $Ca^{2+}$ $Na^+,K^+$(slower) Potential active at normal negative membrane voltage dependent(when AMPA at the same and neighboring synapse) ? Function mediate excitoatory transmission in much the same way as nicotinic receptors mediate synaptic excitation at neuromuscular juncion Cause widespread and lasting changes in the postsynaptic neuron. more than just an ionotropic GABA-Gated and Glycine-Gated Channels GABA mediates most synaptic inhiition in CNS, and glycine mediates most of the rest. Synaptic inhibition must be tightly regulated in the brain. Too much causes a loss of consciousness and coma; too little leads to a seizure. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors And Effectors There are multiple subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors in every known neurotransmitter system. Transmission at these receptors involves three steps: (1) binding of the neurotransmitter to the receptor protein, (2) activation of G-proteins, and (3) activation os effector systems.The Basic Structure of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors Most receptors consists of a single polypeptide containing seven membrane-spanning alpha helices. Two of the extracellular loops of the polypeptide form the transmitter binding sites. Structural variations in thie region determine which neurotransmitters, agonists, and antagonists bind to the receptor, sonsequently. which effector systems are activated in response to transmitter binding.Fig 6.3 - Similarities in the structure of subunit for different transmitter-gated ion channels[link]The Uniquitous G-Proteins There are many more transmitter receptors than G-protein , so many types of G-proteins can be activated by many receptors. Each G-protein has three subunits, termed $\\alpha \\ \\ beta \\ \\ gamma$. In the resting state, a guanosine diphosphate(GDP) molecule is bound to the $G_{\\alpha}$ sub-unit, and the whole complex floats around on the inner surface of the membrane. If this GDP-bound G-protein bumps into the proper type of receptor and if thaat receptor has a transmitter molecule bound to it, then the g-protein releases its GDP and exchanges it for a GTP that it picks up from the cytosol. The activated GTP-bound G-protein splits into two parts: the $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit puls GTP and the $G_{\\beta \\gamma}$ complex. Both can then move on the influence various effector proteins. The $G_{\\alpha}$ subunit is itself an enzyme that eventually breaks down GTP into GDP. Therefore, $G_{\\alpha}$ eventually terminates its own activity by converting the bound GTP to GDP. The $G_{\\alpha}$ and $G_{\\beta \\gamma}$ subunits come back together, allowing the cycle to begin again.G-Protein-Coupled Effector Systems The activated G-proteins exert their effects by binding to either of two types of effector proteins: G-protein-gated ion channels and G-protein-activated enzymes. A variety of neurotransmitters use the short-cut pathway, from receptor to G-protein to ion channel. One example is the muscarinic receptors in the heart. Shortcut pathways are the fastest of the G-protein-coupled systems, having responses beginning within 300-100 msec of neurotransmitter bind. The shortcut pathway is also very localized compared with other effector systems. Beacuase all the action in the shortcut pathway occurs within the membrane, it is sometimes called the membrane-delimited pathway G-proteins can also exert their effects by directly activating certain enzymes(second messenger cascade). Activation of these enzymes can trigger an elaborate series of biochemical reactions, a cascade that often ends in the activation of other \"downstream\" enzymes that alter neuronal funtion. synaptic transmission using transmitter-gated channels is simple and fast. Transmission involving G-protein-coupled receptors is complex and slow. Fig 6.4 - Signal Amplification by G-protein-coupled second messenger cascades.[link]Givergenve and Convergence In Neurotransmitter Systems divergence: The abilit of one transmitter to activate more than one type of postsynaptic response. Divergence is the rule among neurotransmitter systes,.Because of the multiple receptor subtypes, one transmitter can affect different neurons in very different ways. Divergence may occur at any stage in the cascade of transmitter effects. Neurotransmitters can also exhibit convergence of effects. Multiple transmitters, each activating their own receptor type, can converge to influence the same effector system.Fig 6.5 - Divergence and convergence in neurotransmitter signaling systems.Conclusion Neurotransmitters are the essential links between neurons, and between neurons and other effector cells. Transmitters is one link in a chain of events, inciting chemical changes both fast and slow, divergent and convergent.Chapter 7 The Structure of the Nervous SystemIntroduction Nervous system structure is the basis of understanding brain function. The human brain appears complicated because it is distorted as a result of the selective growth of some parts within the confines of the skull.Gross Organization of The Mammalian Nervous SystemThe nervous system of all mammals has two divisions: the central nervous system(CNS) and the peripheral nervous system(PNS).Anatomical References Anatomical References: reference within the brain. Anterior/Rostral : pointing toward the rat's nose( Latin: beak) Posterior/Caudal: pointing toward the rat's tail( Latin: tail) Dorsal: pointing up ( Latin: back) Ventral: pointing down ( Latin: bely) Bilateral symmetry: the right side of the brain and spinal cord is the mirror image of the left side. Midline: the invisible line running down the middle of the nervous system Medial: the structure close to midline Lateral: the structure far away midline Ipsilateral: two structure that are on the same side Contralateral: the structure are on opposite sides of the midlineFig 7.1 - Basic Anatomical references in the nervous system of a rat.(a)side view (b) top view.[link] In the language of anatomists, a lice is called a section; to slice is to section Midsagittal plane: splitting the brain into equal right and left halves Sagittal plane: Sections parallel to the midsagittal Horizontal plane: parallel to the ground Coronal plane: perpendicular to the ground and to the sagittal plane The anatomical planes are perpendicular to each other.The Central Nervous System The central nervous system(CNS) consists of the parts of the nervous system that are encases in bond: the brain and the spinal cord. Cerebrum: the rostral-most and largest part of the brain. The middle plane split down the middle into two cerebral hemispheres, separated by the deep sagittal fissure. In general, the righ cerebral hemisphere receives sensations from, and controls movements of, the left side of the body. Similarly, the left cerebral hemisphere is concerned with sensations and movements on the right side of the body. Cerebellum: lying behind the cerebrum. The cerebellum is primarily a movement control center that has extensive connections with the cerebrum and the spinal cord. In contrast tp the cerebral hemispheres, the left body and the right side of the cerebellum is concerned with movements of the right side. Brain stem: the brain stem forms the stalk from which the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum sprout.The stem is a complex nexus of fivers and cells that relay information from the cerebrum to the spinal cord and cerebellum, and vice versa. Spinal Cord: the spinal cord is encased in the bony vertebral column and is attached to the brain stem. The spinal cord commmunicates with the body via the spinal nerves(part of the peripehral nervous system) Each spinal nerve attaches to the spinal cord by means of two branches, the dorsal root and the ventral root.The Peripheral Nervous System All the parts of the nervous system otherthan the brain and spinal cord comprise the peripheral nervous system(PNS). The PNS has two parts: the somatic PNS and the visceral PNS. The Somatic PNS: all the spinal nerves that innervate the skin, the joints, and the muscles that are under voluntary contraol are part of the somatic PNS. The somatic sensory axons(innervate and collects information from the skin, muscles, and joints) enter the sinal cord via the dorsal roots. The cell bodies of these neurons lie outside the spinal cord in clusters called dorsal root ganglia. The Visceral PNS(Autonomic nervous system ANS): consists of the neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels and glands. When one speaks of an emotional reaction that is beyond voluntary control(butterflies in the stomach), it usually is mediated by the visceral PNS. Afferent and Efferent Axons : indicate whether the axons are transporting information toward or away from a particular point. The Cranial Nerves There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that arise from the brain stem and innervate the head. Some of the cranial nerves are part of the CNS/somatic PNS/visceral PNS.The Meninges The CNS is protected by thress membrane collectively called the meninges. The three membranes are the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater. Dura mater: the outermost covering, forming a tough, inelastic bag that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Arachnoid membrane: lie under the dura mater, with an appearance and a consistency resembling a spider web. Subdural hematoma: if the bood vessels passing through the dura are ruptured, blood can collect her and form what is called subdural hematoma. (normally no space between) Pia mater: a thin membrane that adheres closely to the surface of the brain. Many blood vessels ultimately dive into the substrate of the underlying brain along the pia. Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF): the pia is separated from the arachnoid by a fluid-filled space.&lt;/ul&gt;Fig 7.2 - The menings.[link]#### The Ventricular System &lt;/ul&gt;### Understanding CNS Structure Through Development### A Guide To The Cerebral Cortex### Conclusion--- &lt;/ul&gt;test" }, { "title": "3D Printing for Electrical Connections in Hybrid System", "url": "/posts/injet/", "categories": "Research, Micro/Nano fabrication", "tags": "fabrication", "date": "2022-07-19 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Instructor: Prof. Euisik Yoon from University of MichiganDuration: 05/2022-08/2022Introduction Neural probes play an important role in medical and clinical application. With the help of neural probes, neuroscientists are able to know more about different brain regions and encode the signal of the brain. Hybrid system of neural probes and circuits is one of the important ways to make a neural probes system. However, as recording sites increased, it is challenging to electrically connect between flexible probes and ASICs and PCB. Among all electrical connection techniques, flip-chip bonding is a commonly used method including bonding with anisotropic conductive films (ACF) etc. [1] &lt;/a &gt; &lt; a id = ``ref1'' &gt; &lt;/a &gt; However, ACF needs high temperature, high pressure, and high cost to fabricate. Therefore, developing a feasible, reliable, and high-throughput method to bond flexible probe and CMOS circuits together is necessary. There are a few prospective methods such as inkjet printing. [2] nkjet is gaining importance due to the ease of deposition on 3D and high resolution, which is a potential bonding method for hybrid integration of flexible probe and CMOS circuits. By introducing inkjet printing, the throughput of bonding would be greatly improved. This project aims to use an Inkjet printer(Dimatix DMP2831) to connect the pads of a flexible probe to ASIC and/or PCB. By printing silver ink(SuntronicEMD 5730, conductive ink) on probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads, electrical connection is made between two components. One thing to point out is that the probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads are aligned in advance. As the printing doesn't require high temperature and high pressure, the 3D printing techniques has an advantage over the other methods with fine pitch and high throughput.Experiment &amp; ResultProcess Align flexible probe's pads and ASIC/PCB's pads Fill cartridge with enough conductive ink Draw corresponding patterns same as pads Calibrate printing origin of the printer and calibrate theta Inkjet print ink on the substrate after setting printing origin and patterns Sinter the ink under high temperature(150-250℃) for some time Check printing results under microscopeResults After many times of testing, two main problems appear during printing: leakage and misalignment.Leakage Fig 1. - Printing results taken in inkjet printing camera and microscope. Samples are printed on two types of cables: cable on silicon with aluminum deposited and cables on mockup. According to the above results, instead of forming a drop on the pads, the ink leaks underneath the cables and probes because of surface tension force.Several solutions have been tried while all solutions failed for different reasons: Solution1: Change the way how to place cable and wafer/mockup by using water or IPA with/without baking for better attachment. Results1: Cables might fold during alignment process and water or IPA with/without baking can not attach well enough with substrate. There's always gap between cable and substrate. Solution2: Increase the substrate temperature and accelerate evaporate rate before liquid start to expand. Result2: The ink still leaked at the 60℃, the highest substrate temperature. 30, 45℃ has also been tested but leakage still existed. It's because the sinter temperature is far higher than 60℃. What's worse, higher substrate temperature has a bad effect on cartridge nozzles, making easier to clog. Solution3: flip the cable might help block ink leak by using metal ring. Result3: Failed because there might still a large gap between cable and substrate. Solution4: flip chip bonding the probes and substrates with 200N Result4: and leakage became more severe after flip chip bonding. There are also other potential solution for the problem while they also have some problems with them. Solution1: Solder ball printing(shown in Fig 3.) [3] Concern: It needs electronic grade coating is needed which affects negatively the PCB/ASIC later. It also have high requirement on alignment and have concern in leakage. Solution2: Use a high viscosity ink Concern: The leakage problem might exist and the ink is not capable with the Samba cartridge(a new type of cartridge for the tool) Solution3: Plasma processing Concern: plasma processing will also increase the surface wettability, which might help ink leak. Fig 3. - Siver-bumps based fabrication processMisalignment Fig 2. - Printing results taken in inkjet printing camera and microscope. Samples are printed on two types of cables: cable on silicon with aluminum deposited and cables on mockup. The misalignment happens for a few reasons:Cartridge instability The cartridge can only be used in 2-3 weeks. With too little ink in the cartridge, it will become very hard to control where it print. (~70 microns misalignment). It's easy to clog if the substrate temperature increase while it is expected to increase the temperature to accelerate ink evaporation.Tool Limitation The misalignment often happens in X direction. The step of the motor of Y direction is much smaller than X direction: In X direction, 60μm movement is not reliable while Y direction can move to 10μm. According to the manual, the repeatability of the printer: ± 25μm, negative on the alignment. The printing origin can not remain the same place. Three different results have been received by using the same printing origin and same printing setting(voltage, temperature and nozzle to be used). The three results are in three different direction relative to printing origin while the nozzle work normally under drop watcher.ConclusionEvery possible solution has been tried to save the projects but leakage is an unavoidable physics problem in the project. So the project is unfortunately wrapped up at this point.Reference[1] Park, S. Y., Na, K., Voroslakos, M., Song, H., Slager, N., Oh, S., Seymour, J., Buzsaki, G.; Yoon, E. (2022).

SenturiaDuration: 07/2022-presentChapter 1 Introduction What's in a name?...A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. -- W. Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet1.1 Microsystems vs. MEMS1.1.1 What are they?\"Microelectromechnical systems(MEMS)\": micro establishes a dimensional scale, electro suggests either electricity or electronics(or both), and mechanical suggests moving parts of some kind. But the concept has gown to encompass many other types of small things including thermal, magnetic. fludic, and optical devices and systems, with or without moving parts.In general, MEMS share several common features:MEMS involve both electronic and non-electronic elecments, and perform functions that can include signal acquisition(sensing), signal processing, actuation, display, and control. (performing chemical and biochemical reactions and assays) System issues including packaging, system partitioning into componens, calibration, signal -to-noise ratio, stability, and reliability must be confronted. The most successful MEMS have been those which involve paradigm shifts from the \"macro\" way of doing things. Great examples are inkjet print head, thin-film magnetic disk heads and microfluidic devices. Some MEMS involve large arrays of microfabricated elements, such as uncooled ingrared imaging devices.1.1.2 How are they made?\"micromachining\": Lithographic techiniques require flat susbstrates. Silicon is often used. Lithography offers in-place sub-micron precision on dimension scales from micron and milimeter. Thin-fillm deposition and etching techiniques in combination with wafer-bonding techniques allow patterning of the third dimension. Integrated circuits and partition the microsystem into susbsystems are two ways to build the system. Encapsulation and packaging of the components into a system impact the design too. 1.1.3 What are they made of?The choice of materials is determined by microfabrication constraint. Most of these are inorganic materials, including silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum and tunsten. Certain polymer might be use as well. Certain properties are critical in device performance, for examplt, the elastic modulus or residual stress of a suspended beam.1.1.4 How are they designed?On one level, the designer mush documen the need and specificaiton for a proposed microsystem. At another level, for each proposed approach, one must deal with details of partitioning the system into components, materials selection and the responding fabrication sequences for each componen, methods for packaging and assembly.Quantitive models play a key role in the design process.(perdiction, troubleshooting, evalution)1.2 Markets for Microsystems and MEMS Forecasting is difficult. expecially the future. -- Chinese forture cookies1.3 Case Studies Case Study Partitioning Technology Transduction Packaging Pressure Sensor Monolithic Bulk micromachining with bipolar circuitry plus glass frit wafer bongnig Piezoresistive sensing of diaphram deflection Plastic Accelerometer Monolithic Surface micromachining with CMOS circuitry Capacitive detection of proofmass motion Metal can Resonant Rate Gyroscope Hybrid Bulk micromachined quatz Piezoelectric sensing of rotation-induced excitation of resonant mode Metal can Electrostatically Driven Display Hybrid Surface micromachining using XeF2 release Electrostatic actuation of suspended tensile ribbons Bonded glass device cap plus direct wire bond to ASIC DNA Amplification with PCR Hybrid Bongded etched glass Pressure-driven flow across temperature-controlled zones Microcapillaries attached with adhesive Catalytic Combustible Gas Sensor Hybrid Surface micromachined with selective deposition of catalyst Resistance change due to heat of reaction of combustible gas Custom mounting for research use Table 1.2 Summary of the Case Studies examined in this bookChapter 2 An Approach To MEMS Design If technology-driven design is a hammer looking for a nail, then markei-driven design is a nail looking for a hammer.

Device-todevice consistency is not usually important.)Research Tools: components or fully systems have the porpose of performing a highly specialized task. (must typically be calibrated, and should have repeatable behavior.)Commercial Products:The numbers of working devices and the degree of precision and accuracy needed depend on the market.(Device-todevice consistency and high manufacturing yield are likely to be of paramount importance.)2.1.2 High-Level Design Issues Market: need?

At the top is the system level. A coupled set of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) to describe the dynamical behavior of the system(block-diagram descriptions and lumped-element circuit models), often written in a coupled set of first-order ordinary differential equations for the state variables of the system. At the bottom is the process level. This is where the process sequence and photomask designs for device manufacture are created. (CAD &amp; TCAD)The physical level addresses the behavior of real devices in the threedimensional continuum. The governing equations are typically partial differential equations (PDE's). At device level, create what are called macro-models or reduced-order models in a form that captures the essential physical behavior of a component of the system, and simultaneously is directly compatible with a system-level description.2.2.1 Analytical or Numerical?

The nomenclature is based on the Miller indices. Silicon is a cubic material, constructed from two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices of atoms. The complete silicon unit cell is whon in Fig. 3.1. Every atom is tetrahedrally bonded to four neighbors. The illustration on the left shows an interior atom bound to one corner atom and three face-center atoms(every atom is identical). atom in (111) surface is tetrahedrally bonded to three atoms while atoms on (110) or (100) surfaces are tetrahhedrally bonded to only two atoms beneath the surface, have two potential \"dangling\" bonds. The difference in bonding of the atoms on the different crystal surfaces make certain etchants etch anisotrpically.Fig 3.1. - The tetrahedral bonding of each atom in the silicon unit cell and Cubic unit cell of silicon.Most silicon crystals are grown from a highly purified melt using the Czochralski method(CZ). A small seed crystal with a preselected orientation is inserted into a heated crucible containing a highly purified melt. The seed is gradually pulled out of the melt while the crucible containing the melt is rotated. The melt temperature and pulling speed are controlled to balance crystal growth rate with pulling rate. The schematic of the principle of the Czochralski method is shown in Fig 3.2.An alternative method is called float zone(FZ). Starting with a polysilicon rod, a radio-frequency heater creates a local melted zone that is dragged from one end of the rod to the other. To start the growth, a seed crystal can be used at one end of the rod assembly.Chemical impurities and structural imperfections(point defects, dislocations) specify the quality of silicon crystals. CZ wafers typically have higher amounts of residual chemical impurities, such as carbon, oxygen and heavy metals, compared to FZ wafers because the molten zone tends to carry impurities with it as it sweeps from one end of the rod to the other. However, sometimes it has benefit in certain microelectronic device as the presence of oxygen promotes the migration of point defects during high-temperature process. The higher purity FZ wafers, on the other hand, have requirement of heavy-matal contamination and dislocation. Wafers are supplied in standard diameters and thicknesses, and are polished to mirror smoothness on either one or both sides. Wafers are also characterized by their doping level, n-type or p-type. Dopants are added to the starting melt in order to incorporated uniformly as the crystal grows in CZ crystal growth. Different crystal surface have differnt patterns fo flat edges. Fig. 3.3 show how relative orientation of the secondary wafer flat to thhe larger primary wafer flat provides the identification.Fig 3.2. - Primary and secondary wafer flat are used to identify orientation and types.3.2.1.2 Quartz WafersQuartz is a hexagonal material, with the z-axis conventionally identified as the hexagonal axis. Because of its piezoelectric properties, single-crystal quartz plays an important role in MEMS. Different from silicon wafer, the standard nomenclature for single-crystal quartz substrates is not based on Miller indices. The basic orientations, such as X-cut and Z-cut quartz, refer to the crystalline axes normal to the plane of the wafer, but AT-cut quartz refer to off-axis orientations that are selected for specific temperature insensitivities fo thir piezoelectric or mechanical properties. 3.2.2 Wafer CleaningThe standard set of wafer cleaning steps is called the RCA cleans1. The standard set of wafer cleaning steps is called the RCA cleans (a 7:3 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, \"pirhana\")2. Organic residues are removed in a 5:1:1 mixture of water, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonium hydroxide. Oxide will grow on silicon in this step so dilute HF etch should be inserted to remove the oxide.3. ionic contaminants are removed with a 6:1:1 mixture of water, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. No metallic cations should be contained in the cleaning solutions. The RCA cleans must be performed before every high-temperature step(oxidation, diffusion, or chemical vapor deposition).3.2.3 Oxidation of SiliconThe oxidation reaction is stratghtforward: oxegen reacts directly with the silicon, forming silicon dioxide. The dependence of oxidation rate on oxide thickness has been captured in the Deal-Grove model of oxidation kinetics.If $x_i$ is the initial oxide thickness present on the wafer, then the final oxide thickness $x_f$ is given by$x_f=0.5A_{DG}[\\sqrt{1+\\frac{4B_{DG}}{A^2_{DG}}(t+\\tau_{DG})}-1]$where $A_{DG}$ and $B_{DG}$ are temperature-dependent constants, $t$ is the oxidation time, and $\\tau_{DG}$ is given by$\\tau_{DG}=\\frac{x^2_i}{B_{DG}}+\\frac{x_i}{B_{DG}/A_{DG}}$There are two asymptotic regions. At short times, the square root can be expanded to yield the linear rate model:$x_f=\\frac{B_{DG}}{A_{DG}}(t+\\tau_{DG})$At long times. parabolic rate model is obtained:$x_f=\\sqrt{B_{DG}t}$Overall, about 54% of the total oxide thicknes appears as add thickness. The remaining 46% is conversion of substrate material to oxde. Fig 3.3. shows the consumption.Fig 3.3. - Thermal oxidation consumes some of the wafer thickness.The diffusion rate of oxygen through oxide can be significantly enhanced if there is water vapor present. It is because water breaks a silicon-oxygen-silicon bond, which is more mobile than molecular oxygen.Hense, the oxidation rate is faster. However, dry oxidation is typically used whtn the highest-quality oxides are required. 3.2.4 Local OxidationWhen a portion of a silicon wafer is covered with an oxygen diffusion barrier, such as silicon nitride, oxidation cannot occur. As a result, protected regions of a wafer remain at their original heights, while unprotected regions are converted to oxide. Stress are generated at its edges, creating a tapered oxide called a bird's beak The $LOCOS$ or $Local \\ Oxidation$ isolate individual transistors and interconnecting them without creating parasitic transistors beneath the interconnections.Fig 3.4. - Bird's beaks and its formation are shown in the fig.3.2.5 DopingThere are two types of dopants: p-type(holes) and n-tpe(electrons). When a region contains dopants of both types, it is the net dopant concentration in a region that determines its conductivity type, which means an initially p-type regin can be converted to an n-type region by adding more n-type dopant than p-type dopand amount(counter-doping). The process of doping consisstes of two steps: deposition and drive-in 3.2.5.1 Ion ImplantationIon implantation is a process in which a particle accelerator shoots a beam of dopant atoms directly into the wafer. The dopant atoms stay at a particular depth into the substrate, which is called projected range. The depth depends on the ion energy, the ion species, and the material into which the implantation is performed.The fact that ion implantation has a finite range means that surface layers can be used to mask regions of the wafer, preventing the dopant ion from reaching the wafer. Photoresist, silicon dioxide or silicon nitride are commonly used as implant masks. Because direct ion bombardment into a surface can knock surface atoms loose (sputtering), it is normal to do ion implantation through a thin protective layer, such as a few tens of nm of silicon dioxide. This oxide also tends to scatter the ions slightly as they pass through, providing a range of impact angles into the silicon(channeling). The presence of the oxide layer affects the penetration depth into the substrate, and must be taken into account.3.2.5.2 Drive-In DiffusionIon implantation provides a certain dose of dopants in a layer near the silicon surface. To redistribute these dopants (as well as to remove any residual defects produced by the implantation process), high-temperature anneals with a protective oxide layer to prevent dopant evaporation in a suitable atmosphere are used. The process for redistribution is called diffusion Temperature affects the diffusion constants, and different dopants also have different temperature dependences.y second-order effects that affect diffusion profiles. Boron can dissolve slowly into overlying oxide, slightly depleting the surface concentration. Diffusion rates are also affected by the presence of point defects and by other dopants. Whether or not oxidation is taking place during the drive-in also have influence in diffusion rates.3.2.6 Thin-Film DepositionMany microelectronic process steps involve the deposition and subsequent patterning of a thin film. 3.2.6.1 Physical Vapor DepositionPhysical vapor deposition(PVD), covers two major methods: evaporation, and sputtering. Evapoaration is used primarily for metal and must be donw under high-vacuum. Evaporation with an e-beam is quite directional, allowing interesting shadowing effects to be used. Such method is used to deposit electrodes on the sides of etched quartz microstructures used in accelerometers and rate gyroscopes.Sputtering is a process in which chemically inert atoms, such as argon, are ionized in a glow discharge (plasma). Thhe ions are accelerated into dark space and knocked out to reach the substrate. Sputtering takes palce in a low-pressure gas environment.Though sputtering is less directional than e-beam evaporation, it typically can achieve much higher deposition rates. Therefore, itis the metallization method of choice in most microelectronic manufacturing.Sputtering can also be used with dielectric films, such as silicon dioxide. Some specialty materials, such as the piezoelectric film zinc oxide and aluminum nitride, are well-suited to sputtering.3.2.6.2 Chemical Vapor DepositionChemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a chemical reaction occurs on the surface of the wafer resulting in deposition. CVD depositions are typically performed under low-pressure conditions (less than 1 Torr) and usually involve an inert diluent gas, such as nitrogen, in addition to the reacting species. LPCVD is a typical CVD type. However, the process goes through under high temperature. Thus, it is necessary to perform all CVD processes before any depositions with metals. However, Tungsten is able to withstand CVD temperatures.Epitaxy: If CVD deposition occurs on a single-crystal substrate, it is possible for the underlying crystal to serve as a template for the deposited material to develop as an extension of the single crystal. It is widely used for III-V compounds. If at a given temperature, the deposition rate is slow enough to provide ample time for atoms to migrate along the surface and find equilibrium lattice sites, then epitaxy is possible. At higher deposition rates, the deposition occurs as polycrystalline material called polysilicon. If a portion of the single-crystal is exposes and the rest is covered with silicon dioxide, epitaxial growth can occur over the single-crystal while polisilicon is being posited over the oxide.Deposition rates can be enhanced if the deposition occurs in a glow-discharge plasma. (PECVD) It used to deposit dielectric films at lower temperature. It is extremely important in constructing insulation layers for use with metallization.The material properties can depend in detail on the exact process, including such issues as temperature, gas flow rates, pressures, and the chemistry or morphology of the layer on which the film is deposited.3.2.6.3 ElectrodepositionElectrodeposition, or electroplating, is an electrochemical process in which metal ions in solution are deposited onto a substrate. Metals that are well suited for plating are gold, copper, chromium, nickel, and magnetic iron-nickel alloys (permalloy). Most plating involves control with an applied electric current.The uniformity depends on maintaining a uniform current density. Features of different areas, and regions at the corners of heatures, may plate at different rates. Plating is used in microelectronics to deposit coppoer interconnect and making high-aspect-ratio microstructures(HARM, LIGA).3.2.6.4 Spin CastingThin films can be deposited from solution by a technique called spin casting.The material to be deposited, typically a polymer or chemical precursor to a polymer, is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Spinning is the standard method for depositing photoresist, a photosensitive polymer layer used in photolithography.3.2.6.5 Sol-Gel DepositionSome materials, especially various oxides, can be formed from the sintering of a deposited gel layer that contains a suitable precursor. Spin-on glasses are examples of silicon dioxide deposited in this manner. It is also possible to deposit various piezoelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT), by this method.3.2.6.6 Thin Film StressA major problem with deposited thin films is the control of the state of mechanical stress. All deposited thin films have some degreee of in-plate stress and the stress distribution is sensitive to processing conditionss, and to subsequent thermalhistory such as post-deposition anneals. 3.2.7 Wafer BondingWafer bonding is a method for firmly joining two wafers to create a stacked wafer layer.3.2.7.1 Direct Wafer Bonding of SiliconThe direct bonding of silicon wafers to one another requires high temperatures, on the order of 1000°C. Cleaning and hydration of the surfaces to be bonded.(smooth and particle-free) Using hydrogen bonding of the hydrated surfaces is to provide a modest degree of adhesion. A variation on silicon-to-silicon bonding is that the bottom wafer has a thermal oxide on it. The surfaces are cleaned and hydrated, then contacted and annealed, and the top wafer is thinned. Bonding can also be done on patterned wafers. Piezoresistors can be made in this way, 3.2.7.2 Anodic Bondingfield-assisted bonding, or anodic bonding is related to the mobility of sodium ions in the glass. When the silicon wafer is placed on the glass, and the two are heated to temperatures on the order of 500°C, a positive voltage (300 - 700 V) applied to the silicon repels sodium ions from the glass surface, creating a net negative charge at the glass surface. The force of attraction between the positively charged silicon wafer and the negatively charged glass surface brings the two surfaces into intimate contact. As with silicon-to-silicon bonding, this bonding method is very susceptible to interference from particulate contaminants.3.2.7.3 Bonding with an Intermediate LayerGlass frits, which are powdered slurries of relatively low-melting glasses, can be applied selectively to parts of the surface of one of the wafers using techniques such as screen printing. After a low-temperature bake to reduce the fluid content of the frit layer, the wafers are contacted and annealed, flowing the glass into a continuous layer that bonds the wafers together. Gold layers are also another alternative. Polymic adhesives(polyimides, silicones, epoxy resins) can also be used, provided that the cleanliness and thermal requirements of the device process are not compromised.3.3 Pattern TransferPattern transfer consists of two parts: A photo-process Create the pattern: a chemical or physical process either moving or adding material.3.3.1 Optical Lithography Photoresists, polymeric optically-sensitive materials(spin). Photomask contact or close procimity Ultraviolet light is directed through the mask onto the wafer, exposing the unprotected portions of the resist(chemical properties change). Nagative &amp; Positive(protected region is stay) photoresist. \"Positive resist protects.\" Contact lithograpthy: same size mask. Projection step-and-repeat-lithography: reduced by factor. Process biases and random patterning errors can result in variations in device performance that must be corrected with suitable calibration.3.3.2 Design RulesMisalignment at each step, robust process design calls for the minimum mandatory offsets. Design rules specify a minimum overlap between such mask features so that even in the worst expected misalignment, the fabricated structure is acceptable.3.3.3 Mask Making Layout Optical pattern generator use a photographic emulsion on the quartz plate that becomes optically opaque when exposed and developed. Write pattern into an electron-beam resist. 3.3.3.1 Double-Sided LithographyOne first aligns the back-side mask to fiducial marks on the tool, then places the wafer over this mask, and aligns the wafer to the tool using alignment features on the front. 3.3.3.2 Soft LithographyIt uses a molded polymeric body(PDMS) to accomplish physical pattern transfer.3.3.4 Wet EtchingRemoving Material through the openings in a suitable masking layer.3.3.4.1 Isotropic Wet Chemical Etching A suitable liquid chemical attacks the exposed region of the substrate and leaves the protected regions alone. The rate of etching and the shape of the resulting etched feature depend on many things: the type of substrate, the specific chemistry of the etchant, the choice of masking layer (and the tightness of its adhesion to the substrate), the temperature (which controls reaction rates), and whether or not the solution is well stirred (which affects the rate of arrival of fresh reactants at the surface). reaction-rate controlled / mass-transfer-limited. Most wet etching is isotropic, not depending on orientations. If the materials underneath is etched, it referred to surface micromachining. One significant technology problem in surface micromachining is the unintended adhesion of released mechanical elements to the substrate. Stiction: When using a wet release etch, the surface tension during drying can pull compliant beams into contact with the substrate, and during the final drying, they can adhere firmly together. Solution: the use of self-assembled molecular monolayers (SAM's) to coat the surfaces during the final rinse with a thin hydrophobic layer, reducing the attractive force;the use of vapor or dry-etching release methods(XeF2) various drying methods (freeze drying and drying with CO2) temporary mechanical support of the moveable structure during release using posts of photoresist or some other easily removed material. Wet etching can also be used to etch deeply into the substrate.(bulk micromachining).3.3.4.2 Anisotropic Wet EtchingThe mechanisam responsible for orientation dependent etching in silicon is the detailed bond structure of the atoms that are revealed in different surface planes. As etching proceeds, the exposed {100} planes etch rapidly while the {111} planes etch slowly. Every {111} plane intersects a (100) surface along one of the &lt;110&gt; directions shown in Fig 3.5.. Hence, starting from every straight mask edge that is aligned with one of the &lt;110&gt; directions, a slow-etching {111} plane becomes revealed by the etch. It makes a 54.7° angle with the plane of the wafer, the characteristic feature of anisotropically etched bulk-micromachined structures.Fig 3.5. - When a (100) oriented wafer with mask features aligned to &lt;110&gt; directions is placed in an anisotropic etchant.{100} planes etch rapidly, but {111} plenes etch slowly.This undercutting phenomenon extends to other shapes. Other typical etching samples also shown in Fig 3.6. Undercutting has important implications for alignment accuracy. The bounding rectangular etch pit is what determines the final etched shape.Fig 3.6. - Other examples of etching a (100) oriented wafer3.3.4.3 Etch Stops for Wet Etching Electrochemical Etch Stop(Electrochemical passivatoin) When a silicon wafer is biased with a sufficiently large anodic potential relative to the etchant, it tends to oxidize. The oxide on the surface masks the etch. The use of this electrochemical property to control the thickness. The depth of the junction can be accurately controlled by the combination of ion implantation and drive in. p+ Etch Stop If instead of using an n-type diffusion into a p-wafer, a heavily boron doped p+ layer is formed by ion implantation and diffusion, the anisotropic etch will terminate without requiring application of anodic bias. The etch-rate selectivity is not quite as high as for passivating oxides. Residual Tensile stress might affect the performance Dielectric Etch Stop Some layer is replaced by a material that is not etched, for example. silicon nitride No Etch Stop: Making Through Holes If no etch stop is used, a hole is produced all the way through the wafer. The sloped sidewalls of the holes also offer an opportunity for making interconnects between the back and the front of a wafer. 3.3.5 Dry EtchingChemically reactive vapors and the reactive species in glow-discharge plasmas are highly effective etchants. These are classified into two groups: vapor etching, and plasma-assisted etching. 3.3.5.1 Vapor Etching$XeF_2$ is a highly selective vapor etchant for silicon. It is ideal for the dry release of surface micromachined structures in which polysilicon is used as the sacrificial layer. 3.3.5.2 Plasma-Assisted EtchingIon Milling: The least selective use of ions produced in a plasma is for the sputtering away of material. Selectivity is achieved by the relative rate of sputtering of different materials.A variant of this process is focused ion beam milling, using an argon ion source in combination with focusing electrodes so that ions from the plasma only strike the surface within a small region.Ashing: When the ions have some chemical reactivity, such as the ions produced in an oxygen plasma, the result of reaction of the ionic species with the surface of the wafer can be a volatile species that is removed by the vacuum pump. Material to be etched Etcha gas Silicon or polysilicon $CF_4$,$SF_6$ Silicon dioxide $CF_4/H_2$ Silicon nitride $CF_4/O_2$ Organics $O_2$, $O_2/CF_4$,$O_2/SF_6$ Aluminum $BCl_3$ The shape of a plasma-etched feature is a strong function of the etching conditions. The higher the base pressure in the plasma, the more isotropic the etch profile. reactive ion etching at the limit of low pressures and a correspondingly high degree of directionality. Sidewalls are not significantly etched because the ions do not strike them.Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE): This process takes advantage of a side-effect of a glow discharge, the tendency to create polymeric species by chemical crosslinking. Fig 3.7. - Photo of features etched in silicon with DRIE.3.3.6 Additive Processes: Lift-Offlift-off: When metal is etched with patterns and the resist(photoresist and metal on it) is stripped, the matal on top of the resist is \"lifted-off\"&lt;/p&gt;Fig 3.8. - Lift-off for patterning evaporated metals.It exploits the deposition of the evaporated metal onto the edges of the masking layer, gradually closing off the opening.The evaporated layer at the substrate becomes conical in shape, finally reaching a sharp point when the masking layer closes off completely.(Spindt Process)Fig 3.9. - The use of a midified lift-off process to create sharp tips.### 3.3.7 PlanarizationThere are three primary difficulties with non-planar surfaces:etching processes can leave behind unetched \"stringers\" non-planar wafers cannot be successfully bonded; and, lithography is compromised, both by the difficulty of obtaining uniform resist deposition over non-planar surfaces and by the limited depth of focus of high-resolution lithographic exposure tools.#### 3.3.7.1 StringersWhen this film is patterned, it can be difficult to remove the material on the sidewall of the lower layer. This remaining thin slice is called a stringer.One good method for doing this is to planarize the surface before depositing structural layers. There are two widely used planarization methods: chemical mechanical polishing, and resist etchback. Resist etchback depends, in turn, on the planarization that results from spin-casting of polymer films.Fig 3.10. - The formation of stringers and the bad results.#### 3.3.7.2 Chemical Mechanical Polishingchemical mechanical polishing, or CMP: Wafer polishing is a process in which the wafer is pressed against a rotating platen on which an abrasive slurry is provided. Successive dielectric layers are planarized before performing the patterning step of opening vias to permit connection to lower layers. The vias are then filled with metal, after which, the next layer of conductor is deposited and patterned. By using planarized layers, extremely accurate lithography can be performed over complex subsurface topography.#### 3.3.7.3 Planarization with PolymersSpin-cast polymers tend to planarize substrate topographies. Polyimides are often used for planarization. Because these materials can function at temperatures above 300°C, they can remain as part of the structure. Another polymer that can be used for planarization is the SU-8 resist.#### 3.3.7.4 Resist EtchbackPlanarization by a polymer can be exploited to planarize an oxide layer over which the polymer is deposited. Photoresist is deposited over oxide topography so as to planarize that topography. Wafer is then plasma etched with an etch recipe that etches the photoresist at about the same rate as the underlying oxide. This results in a much more planar oxide surface.---# Chapter 4 Process Integration&gt; Castles in the air - They're so easy to take refuge in. So easy to build, too.&gt; -- Henrik Ibsen, in The Wild Duck" }, { "title": "Abdominal Medical Images Segmentation with CNN-Transformer Hybrid Model", "url": "/posts/image-segementation/", "categories": "Projects, Machine Learning", "tags": "machine learning", "date": "2022-05-06 18:06:00 -0400", "snippet": "EECS545 Coursework ProjectDuration: 02/2022-05/2022Teammates: Haowen Chen, Yuang Lu, Yuqi Yan, Ying YuanIntroduction During Diagnosis, treatment and surgery with computer aid, medical image segmentation plays a crucial part in identifying pixels of anatomical objects in medical images. However, it is a time-consuming and heavy work to conduct segmentation on images one by one by doctors. The primary challenges for segmentation mainly come from three aspects: (1) Complex boundary interactions, (2) Large appearance variation, (3) Low tissue contrast. These challenges. With the advance of deep learning, it is necessary to conduct new techniques to help medical image segmentation. [1] In this project, we focused on the abdominal multi-organs segmentation problem. We proposed two novel neural network structures to solve two main problems: fragmental objects edges and failure to detect small, direction-dependent objects. The performance of medical image segmentation is expected to be enhanced by fusing Self Attention mechanism and convolutional neural network. Related Work In this section, recent work for medical image segmentation will be gone through. To achieve pixel-wise classification, researchers proposed the encoder-decoder network structure. UNet is one of the most outstanding works among them. Based on the structure, novel techniques have been introduced into UNet. [2] ResUNet Residual UNet(ResUNet) [3] is inspired by ResNet. [4] Previous results showed that with the number of network layers increased, the feature identities and performance will be lost. It is caused by vanishing gradients in deep networks. By concatenating features, the skip connection before downsampling or upsampling in ResUNet helps preserve feature maps. According to our results, ResUNet is capable of detecting all 13 organs in the Synapse dataset including small and directional objects such as the left and right adrenal gland. However, all other transformer-based models failed to do so. It can also perform better in segmenting other small organs such as portal vein and splenic vein. It is believed that the convolutional layer helps the model to detect and segmentate these small objects.TransUNet TranUNet is a model based on Transformers and UNet, leveraging both detailed high-resolution spatial information from CNN features and the global context encoded by Transformers. Transformer serves as a strong encoder, providing an attentive feature sequence. According to former results, this architecture achieves superior performance over any other method on medical image segmentation. Therefore, TransUNet works as the baseline model in this project and implements a novel model. [5] Swin-UNet Based on the outstanding performance in Trans-UNet, optimization of Transformer might be opt for image segmentation. Swin-UNet could be one among them. Different from all silices connected together in Trans-UNet, the limited slices are connected with the neighboring slices in Swin-UNet. When in the higher layer, the output from the neighbor transformer will be the input of the next layer. By this way, more details from the images could be trained and neighboring information could affect each other. [6] Though Swin-UNet has higher DICE score over TransUNet overall, which means that it could better classify each pixel in the right class, the results showed that the segmented objects trained by Swin-UNet are fragmental and have rougher edges compared to TransUNet.UTNet Although transformer variants perform well in vision tasks, pixels packed in the same input image patch do not contain enough spatial information, leading to weaker inductive bias compared with traditional CNN. Therefore, vision transformer-based models require a large image set to gain enough prior knowledge in the image domain. However, a major characteristic of medical image segmentation tasks is that they usually cannot provide such a big dataset, using pretrained weight on other large image datasets then becomes a widely adopted solution. UTNet, unlike other models, employs another method. Common vision transformers and their variants pack pixels into patches and flattening them into vectors while UTNet preserves the first few encoding layers as convolutional layers, the pixel-level spatial relations thus can be retained. [7] UNETR UNETR proposed a novel transformer-based model for volumetric medical image segmentation. Instead of extracting features with Transformers at the bottleneck of U-Net, UNETR has its skip-connected decoder that combines representation from multiple intermediate Transformers layers. Deconvolutional layers are applied to these intermediate representations to increase the resolution. Such architecture helps the network capture global contextual representation at multiple scales and increase the capability for learning long-range dependencies. [8] TransFuse In order to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts and preserve low-level features, TransFuse uses a parallel approach to merge Transformers and CNNs. This allows the efficient collection of both global dependencies and low-level spatial features in a significantly shallower manner. The BiFusion module is a novel fusion technique that efficiently fuses the multi-level features from both branches. According to the research, TransFuse obtains state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical picture sets with significantly fewer parameters and significantly faster inference. [9] Proposed Method In our novel models, Swin-Transformer and UTNets act as encodes to learn sequence representations of the input and further enhance the efficiency in capturing the global information. The overall diagram of the proposed model is shown in Fig. 1. Fig 1. - PipelineThis model consists of two parallel branches that process information differently1. CNN Branch It gradually increases the receptive field and encodes the feature from local to global.With the Transformer branch to obtain global context information instead, CNN branch could be shallower, and the proposed model could be also retaining richer local information.The output of the 3rd block ($\\textbf{l}^1\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{16} \\times \\frac{W}{16}\\times C_1 }$), 2nd block ($\\textbf{l}^2\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{8} \\times \\frac{W}{8}\\times C_2 }$), and 1st block ($\\textbf{l}^3\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{4} \\times \\frac{W}{4}\\times C_3 }$)) are fused with the results from Transformer. We propose different models with CNN variants. 2. Transformer Branch It starts with global self-attention and recovers the local details at the end. The input image $\\textbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times 3}$ is first evenly divided into $N =\\frac{H}{16} \\times \\frac{W}{16}$ patches. Then the consecutive $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ upsampling-convolution layers is used to obtain $\\textbf{z}^1\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{16} \\times \\frac{W}{16}\\times D_1 }$, $\\textbf{z}^2\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{8} \\times \\frac{W}{8}\\times D_2 }$, and $\\textbf{z}^3\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{H}{4} \\times \\frac{W}{4}\\times D_3 }$. We propose different models with transformer variants.3. BiFusion ModuleIt fuses the encoded features of the same resolution extracted from CNN and Transformer branch. The fused feature $\\textbf{b}^i, i = 1,2,3$ is obtained by the following operations:$\\hat{\\textbf{z}}^i = \\text{ChannelAttn}({\\textbf{z}}^i)$$\\hat{\\textbf{l}}^i = \\text{SpatialAttn}({\\textbf{l}}^i)$$\\hat{\\textbf{c}}^i = \\text{Conv}(\\textbf{z}^i\\textbf{W}_1^i\\odot\\textbf{l}^i\\textbf{W}_2^i)$$\\hat{\\textbf{b}}^i = \\text{Residual}([\\hat{\\textbf{c}}^i,\\hat{\\textbf{z}}^i,\\hat{\\textbf{l}}^i])$ where $\\textbf{W}_1^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_i\\times L_i}$, $\\textbf{W}_2^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C_i\\times L_i}$, $|\\odot|$ is the Hadamard product and Conv is a $3\\times3$ convolution layer. The channel attention is implemented according to the SE-Block proposed by to facilitate global information from the Transformer branch. [10] The spatial attention is adopted from CBAM block as spatial filters to enhance local details. [11] 4. Attention-gated skip-connection It combines fused feature maps and generates the segmentation. [12] We obtain $\\hat{\\textbf{f}}^{i+1} = \\text{Conv}([\\text{Up}(\\hat{\\textbf{f}}^{i}), \\text{AG}({\\textbf{f}}^{i+1}, \\text{Up}(\\hat{\\textbf{f}}^{i}))])$ and $\\textbf{f}^{1}=\\hat{\\textbf{f}}^{1}$. With this branch-in-parallel approach, firstly, global information can be captured and sensitivity could be preserved on low-level context without building deep nets; secondly, the fused representation would be powerful and compact with the BiFusion module by utilizing the different features of CNN and Transformer simultaneously.Swin-Fuse In order to solve the problem of fragmental edges of Swin-UNet, the Swin-Transformer is optimized with the BiFusion module. By funding the encoder of ResNet and encoder od Swin-Transformer together, low level details captured by the CNN branch and the global information captured by the Transformer branch can be combined together by the BiFusion module and then sent to the decode/ The hybrid model therefore can preserve the strength of high prediction accuracy of Swin-UNet and further improve the model's ability of restoring edges of organs with the help of the captured low-level details. Swin-Fuse is trained with ADA&lt; optimizer with learning rate set to 0.001 Beta1 and Beta 2 are set to 0.5 and 0.999 correspondingly. The loss of the output is the weighted sum of the cross entropy and DICE score with weights of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross entropy and DICE loss are calculated based on the intermediate result and final result, consistent with the method introduced by the TransFuse.UT-Fuse In practice, all transformer-based models such as Trans-UNet, Swin-UNet, UTNet and hybrid models like TransFuse and Swin-Fuse failed to segment left adrenal gland and right adrenal gland. After analyzing the characteristics of these two organs, it is found that they are small and direction-dependent organs, that they are located almost in the same slice of the 3D CT scan, and only differentiating in the direction (left and right oriented) and the relative location in the 2D image. In order to successfully segment these two organs, the model's ability of classifying small organs based on the neighboring organ and also tell the direction of organs is needed to enhance. Therefore, we proposed UT-Fuse, fusing ResNet and UTNet with the BiFusion module. The model is capable of capturing pixel-level details from the input image from both the transformer branch and the CNN branch. The transformer branch will also process the location information with global self-attention. Since both branches have an intermediate convolutional layer, neighboring organs have stronger connections and the model can detect direction dependent organs based on the relative location with other organs. Training method and parameters of UT-Fuse is consistent with that of Swin-Fuse.Implementation Synapse multi-organ image segmentation dataset acts as the data in this project, that was originally used for the MICCAI 2015 Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labeling Challenge. [13] 50 abdomen CT scans are included in the dataset. To align with previous works, 30 out of 50 scans are used for this project. These CT scans range from $512 \\times 512 \\times 85$ to $512 \\times 512 \\times 198$ in pixels with resolution varying from $0.54 \\times 0.54$ $mm^2$ to $0.98 \\times 0.98$ $mm^2$. 13 different organs, including spleen, stomach, liver, etc. are labeled pixel by pixel. 3D CT scan is cut into $512 \\times 512$ pixel 2D images, and splited 12 out of 30 scans as testing images, which is consistent to preprocessing techniques mentioned in SwinUNet and TranUNet. Models such as TranUNet and SwinUNet use pretrained weight on large image dataset while novel architectural models like UTNet use a unique down-sampling method that requires specific image dimension. Therefore, the image is cropped to [224,224] or [256, 256] in dimension corresponding to the model requirements. In order to improve the robustness of the model, data augmentation methods such as random flip and random rotation have been applied.Evaluation Though many transformer-based models reported better performance compared to traditional Res-UNet, only models of comparable sizes are used for evaluation. For example, Res-UNet based on ResNet-34 which has 63.5 million parameters and TransUNet based on vit-base-patch 16-224 which has 86 million parameters are used as reference models. The implemented hybrid model uses the pre-trained weight of ResNet-34 and Tiny Swin-Transformer (28 million parameters). For medical images segmentation, there are two types of errors related to segmentation accuracy, namely the delineation of the boundary (contour) and the size (volume of the segmented object). Two metrics for these two types of errors are selected based on literature review. [14] Dice Coefficient, also called the overlap index, is the most used metric in validating medical image segmentation, which is defined as$DICE = \\frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}$Hausdorff Distance(HD) measures the distance between crisp volumes. Given two point sets $A$ and $B$, HD is defined by$HD(A, B) = \\max(h(A, B), h(B,A))$where $h(A, B)$ is called the directed Hausdorff distance and given by$h(A, B) = \\max_{a\\in A}\\min_{b\\in B} ||a-b||$where $||\\cdot||$ is a norm(normally Euclidean distance). Note that HD is sensitive to outliers and the $q$-th quantile of distances may be used instead of the maximum, so that possible outliers are excluded.Result Analysis In this part, the average Dice Coefficient and average Hausdorff Distance(HD) on 13 organs will be reported. The organs included spleen, right kidney, left kidney, gallbladder, esophagus, liver, stomach, aorta, inferior vena cava, portal vein and splenic vein, pancreas, right adrenal gland, and left adrenal gland. They are splitted of 18 training cases (2212 axial slices) and 12 cases for validation. Table 1 and Table 2 showed the results comparison.

According to our result, the classified organs from Swin-Fuse could be properly shaped, while edged from Swin-UNet is fragmental, as shown in Fig.2. Comparing mean DICE score and mean HD95 of Swin-Fuse(63.90%, 18.22) and TransUNet(54.42%, 23.54), Swin-UNet has a better performance.UT-Fuse UT-Fuse which is fused by hybrid UTNet and ResNet-34 has a better DICE score compared to other Transformer-based models. With a margin of 3.61\\% higher than UTNet (67.05\\%) and 16.24\\% higher than the original TransUNet. The HD95 of UT-Fuse is also better than other models. The mean DICE score of UT-Fuse is 15.73, beating the second place, Swin-Fuse, by 18.22. UT-Net can also classify and segment small and direction dependent objects such as right and left adrenal gland which all other Transformer-based models failed to segment, with DICE score of 45.91\\% and 50.33\\%, and HD95 of 7.55 and 6.40. Though UT-Fuse has a lower DICE score than Res-UNet (70.66\\% compared to 72.35\\%), the HD95 of UT-Fuse (15.73) is much better than that of Res-UNet (24.92). The performance of UT-Fuse is generally better than almost all other models, however, it is inferior to UTNet in several classes. An interesting observation is that both Res-UNet and UTNet have higher DICE scores for gallbladder than UT-Fuse even though UT-Fuse is composed of these two models. This problem is possibly caused by the unclear boundary of gallbladder with other organs, when the BiFusion module fusing two separate models, information captured by lower layers are mixed up, which makes the model harder to separate Gallbladder and other organs.Reference[1] Sihang Zhou, Dong Nie, Ehsan Adeli, Jianping Yin, Jun Lian, and Dinggang Shen. 2019.

These positioning components can be used as micro-mirrors or lenses in optical application [1,2,3] or they could serve as actuators in scanning probe microscopy [4,5] , sensors in micro-force measuring [6,7] , or even used in data storage systems [8,9,10] . According to the applications, these mechanical positioning components may require different operation specifications, for example limitations in component sizes, requirement for specific natural frequencies, or the need for a certain maximum displacement. To fulfill these different kinds of specification goals, the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology has been investigated intensively. MEMS technology is desirable in designing and fabricating these micro/nano positioning components due to its advantages of small sizes and its numerous available sensing/actuating schemes to meet therequired specs for different applications.For the use of nano stages in metrology applications, several different types of MEMS positioning stages have been investigated including electrostatic, thermal and piezoelectric actuated positioning stages. [11,12,13] However, based on the fabrication techniques in this course, Thermal actuation methods were the most suitable design. It is because these actuating methods do not require the use of exotic materials or electrical isolation, making it compatible with general IC fabrication. Another outstanding feature for thermal actuating is that various kinds of displacement amplification schemes are available.Traditional sensors made of metal foils and semiconductor piezoresistive elements have limited sensitivity, high temperature dependence and are not compatible with standard CMOS integration, making them unsuitable for high-performance and low-cost applications. However, MEMS capacitive sensors have key advantages such as high sensitivity, minimal temperature dependance, low noise, large dynamic range and potential monolithic integration with low-power MOS electronics. Our design is aimed at a high-sensitivity low-noise Nano-stage. Microsystem OperationIn this design, the capacitive MEMS sensor is integrated with a low-noise CMOS circuit. The CMOS circuit(Capacitive Sensing Amplifier, Mixer, Low Pass Filter, Digital Analog Converter and Controller) utilizes a closed-loop architecture by sensing capacitance change from the stage and controlling its movement by driving circuit based on users' instructions. Signal from the driving circuit will actuate the MEMS stage, leading it to the right place. Meanwhile, the sensing part from the circuit will give real time feedback to the controller in order to adjust the provided actuating voltage. The real time feedback can also translate into displacement. AC signal will be provided for sensing circuit and DC signal will be the actuation supply. This research takes advantage of the displacement amplifying scheme available for thermal actuators to maximize displacement and incorporates a mirrored mechanical design to avoid rotation. Furthermore, a closed loop circuit then further enhances the precision of the translation nano stage. Fig 1. shows General block diagram of the whole micro-system.

The actuation ports serve as the displacement actuators. Fig 2. - Top view of the MEMS positioning stage, including center silicon stage, force transmitting and displacement amplifying arm, electrical ports and bottom electrode.The working principle of the MEMS device is that an input current(I) is applied at the actuation port on the thermal actuators.The Joule heating caused by the current will create a temperature change.($\\Delta T$) This will lead to a displacement(disp) due to the thermal expansion of the the actuators. The displacement amplifying arms that are connected to the thermal actuators are used to amplify the thermal displacement and will transmit the amplified displacement(disp*) on the center stage through the force transmitting arms. In the end, the position changes of the center stage due to the thermal actuation will lead to a change in the overlap area between the center stage and bottom sensing electrodes. With the center stage serving as one part of the parallel plate capacitor, and the bottom sensing electrodes serving as the other part, the change in capacitance can be sensed. The whole process will be shown in Fig. 3. Fig 3. - Working principles of MEMS stage.The design is also limited by the area(Electrode Pad), which is required to be $2mm \\times 2mm$. Additionally, to avoid temperature jump to extremely high locally, the input current should be less than 0.25A. However, based on the primary stimulation results, at least 0.2A on a single port could make the stage move when the stage could move in 2 DOF. In order to have the maximum displacement, 1 DOF is sacrificed. And one chevron requires four driving pads (two actuation pads, two group pads).When moving in 1 DOF, potential rotation is taken into consideration. The thermal actuators and the displacement amplifying arms ,as well as the force transmitting arm, are mirrored design. This mirrored structure is extremely important to limit the movement in Y-direction and avoid rotation in X-direction.The optimization of the dimensions for the MEMS devices(the width and length of chevrons, the width and length of arms, the distance between to supporting beams and so on) was verified through COMSOL simulation.Thermal analysis was conducted in COMSOL to ensure that thermal actuators were operating at a tolerable temperature. Naturally, the higher temperature the actuators are, the more thermal expansion and thus displacement the device will be able to achieve. Based on the maximum operating temperature of around 1000K for a similarly designed thermal actuator in paper, we aimed to design the stage maximum operating temperature of 1000K. Fig 4 shows the temperature simulation results of the actuator and the stage. The square and circle-labeled lines show the simulation results with a temperature-correct conductivity for silicon. Based on these results, nonlinear increase in temperature with respect to an increase in input current. The maximum temperature can be reached within the current limit in this design. Fig 4. - Temperature analysis of stageElectrical analysis was also conducted to ensure the potential drift at the center stage was under acceptable level. There are two main causes leading to the electrical potential value of the stage during actuation: (1) MEMS structure is not electrically isolated different components (The structure is not only mechanically, but also electrically connected) (2) Stage is one part of the sensing electrode and play a important role in sensing circuit. A large potential drift during actuation may drive the circuit bias out of working range. The simulation results in Fig 5 shows that the stage potential is affected by input current. However, the potential can be kept under 1.8V of the interface circuit within the driving range of 0.5A.(Two pads drive one chevron.) Fig 5. - Electrical analysis of stageNext, two mechanical analyses were conducted to verify the performance of the MEMS structure. Rotation analysis is to ensure the stage undergoes pure translational motion, while actuation analysis is to calculate the maximum displacement achievable. The results are shown in Fig 5 respectively. The simulation results show that displacement amplifying arms were effective and an amplification factor of around 5.7 was achieved. The center stage was able to achieve $13 \\mu m$ of displacement when the actuators are at the maximum operating temperature of 1000K.In the end, the overall expected capacitance output of the area-changing sensing capacitor was calculated from the simulated displacement results. Fig 6. shows that the sensing capacitor of each is able to reach a maximum capacitance change($\\Delta C$) of 19.1 fF atan initial capacitance($C_0$) of 350fF. Fabrication ProcessThe process begins with a silicon wafer with a bare $500\\mu m$ thick glass wafer. After evaporation of 1000Å Cr as glass etch mask, photoresist is then spined on the metal layer and exposed with GLASS RECESS mask. The Cr without photoresist protection is then etched and stopped until the glass recess reaches the depth of $3\\mu m$. Cr and photoresist are striped at this time.In the second mask process, the bottom electrode is deposited and patterned at this time50Å Cr and 500Å Pt will be deposited respectively after bottom electrode opening is patterned. After Lifting off the Cr/Pt and photoresist, the bottom electrode layer is left behind.In the third mask process, the whole wafer is bonded $100\\mu m$ Silicon and deposited 5000ÅAl. Photoresist is also the protection layer. In the end of this step, the contact metal layer is successfully patterned on the wafer.In the last step, photoresist works as the protection layer for Si wafer in the DRIE process. Finally, the photoresist is removed and the MEMS stage. Fig 6. - Fabrication processCircuit DesignIn this session, design and simulation results for custromized circuits willbe discussed in detail.The following table shows the specs of each components.

CSA is a two-stage Miller op-amp with PMOS input pairs. By using this architecture, By connecting $C_f$ as feedback capacitor, the gain, bandwidth and other parameters can be trade off better. There are two CSA in the circuit. The inputs (negative and positive) of one CSA are the interface ports from the MEMS. The other CSA inputs are dummy capacitors for comparison. Fig 7. and Fig 8. is the simulation results of Open-looped CSA and Close-looped CSA. Fig 7. - Open-loop CSA simulation results(AC Analysis) Fig 8. - Close-loop CSA simulation results(AC Analysis)Mixer and Low Pass Filter(LPF)Mixer compares two outputs from the CSA and compares the capacitor change. Mixer consists of a fully differential op-amplifier, demodulator and common-mode feedback. Demodulator is implemented with 4 NMOS switches. Miller compensation is implemented for common-mode feedback(CMFB). [14] Parameters of op-amp in CSA and mixer are completely the same. As for the CMFB, the transistors are fine-tuning based on the gain and frequency.The output waveform shows in Fig. 9. is the AC simulation of the mixer. By comparing two inputs, the output is the results from the capacitance change. From the simulation results, Linearity and enough amplification could be told. Fig 9. - Mixer simulation results(AC Analysis)After filtering noise, Fig 10. shows overall simulation result sweep with different $\\Delta C$. The linearity decreases as $\\Delta C$ approaches 20fF but the overall linearity is workable with a sensitivity of 3.5mV/fF. Fig 10. - Output signal with different $\\Delta C$Digital Analog Convertor(DAC)The DAC uses an R2R ladder due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This consideration also provides a clean signal with low power consumption. Fig 11. shows the simulation results for the R2R ladder. The DAC can supply 256 evenly spaced voltage levels, corresponding to 256 discrete stage positions. Fig 11. - Simulation results for the DAC.ControllerThe controller compares the user's desired stage(the output of the DAC) and the sensed stage position(the output of the sensing circuit). After that, the actuating signal will change until the difference between the two inputs is zero. According to the simulation results, the design results in a slightly underdamped response with correct output and a very quick response time of 7.14ns. Noise and Power Consumption AnalysisNoise will affect the overall performance of the customized circuit. Noise is an unwanted signal that creates disturbance to the desired signal content in the system. This can be an additional signal that is produced by the system or can be some disturbance accompanied with the desired information of the input signal. CSA is the main source of noise for the signal chain. Therefore, it is necessary to have LNF followed before.And power consumption is also important to the circuit, which is expected to be low. It is calculated from the circuit current of the operational amplifier itself and from the output load current.The following table shows the noise and power consumption of CSA and Mixer. The power and noise from LPF can be neglected. Componentsm Noise Power CSA 360 $\\mu$Vrms 208.7 $\\mu$W Mixer 125 $\\mu$Vrms 176.4 $\\mu$W TestIn this session, the testing process and results will be presented. The overview graph in the microscope of the MEMS devices during testing has been shown in Fig 12. Two types of vernier scales were utilized to characterize the motion of displacement of the center stage. Combining information from two vernier scales together regarding the X,Y displacement, the rotational motion can also be known during actuation. The horizontal vernier scale indicates that the mirrored structural design was effective in minimizing any rotational motion occurring rendering the displacement of the center stage almost purely translational. Fig 11. - a) Micrograph overview of the fabricated MEMS devices, and b) zoom-in micrographs of the horizontal and vertical vernier scales used for measuring stage displacement.Before measuring the stage overall displacement, resistance of two different types of chevrons measures first in order to be compared with theoretical simulation. The two different types of chevrons differ in pairs of actuating legs, and thus should in theory show different values in electrical resistance, $R_{small}$ and $R_{large}$. Fig 12 b). shows the simulation and measurement results of resistance of a single chevron. The simulated results and the measured results also indicate an increase in resistance as input current increases, reflecting the effect of increased phonon scattering that decreases the carrier structure and thus conductivity of the heavily doped silicon structure. However, different from the ideal simulated resistance, the measured results do not show a large difference in resistance between $R_{small}$ and $R_{large}$. It might be because single measured results are outlying data points. It might also be because there is no electrical isolation between chevrons. More thorough experimentation is needed to produce more accurate quantitative results of the chevron resistances. Fig 12 a) Schematic of two types of chevron design, respectively with resistance $R_{large}$ and $R_{small}$ and, b) measurement and simulation results of resistances of a single chevrons for $R_{large}$ and $R_{small}$Furthermore, in Fig 13. shows the displacement of the center stage changes as the currents increase. As the input current changes from 0.3A to 0.4A, the center stage deforms by 3.33 $\\mu m$ to 22.2 $\\mu m$ with the breakage occurring at 0.39 A with displacement of 13.9 $\\mu m$. Due to the lower measured resistance of the chevron, compared to the simulated resistances, a larger input current is required to displace the center stage. This results in a right shifted measured displacement curve in red compared to the R-corrected simulation displacement curve in blue. Fig 13 Measurement and simulation results of the center stage dispalcement in the Y direction.Lastly, the breakage of the devices is shown in Fig 14. A mechanical failure was visible at the connecting hinge between the actuating chevrons and the displacement amplifying arm when the current was larger than 0.39A. To verify this breakage, the simulation result also showed that the stress was concentrated at the same location in which breakage was observed to occur. From the simulation result. Fig 14. Overview and zoom-in of simulated stress results, as well as breakage micrograph in actual MEMS testing.In conclusion, the measurement results of the MEMS device show a maximum displacement without breakage of 14 $\\mu m$ abd is comparable to the maximum displacement result of 13 $\\mu m$ from simulation results. No roation motion has been found during testing. And the location breakage of the structure can also be well predicted by the simulation. Summary and ConclusionIn this research, a thermally-actuated 1 Degree-Of-Freedom translation nano-stage with displacement amplification schemes and a rotation-motion suppressing mirrored structure was designed and implemented. To control and read the stage position, a closed-loop feedback sensing and actuating circuit was designed in order to give the user a precise and consistent interface.

More features can be added into the system including Noise measurement to improve position readiing accuracy. Disturbance might be a problem during moving, which might bring external force into the subject. Specific mechanical design might be needed if the disturbance affects the system largely. Besides, amplification structure can be further improved.Without strict design rules regulation, the 1 DOF system can also further develop into 2 DOF or more direction of movement.Update Block Digram laterReference[1] M.

This project aims to design a CMOS wideband Transimpedance amplifier(TIA) that is capable of operating within a 5Gbps system. Lower bandwidth might cause pattern-dependent jitter and lower signal-to-noise ratio. It is also important to ensure gain high enough that input signals generate output levels exceeding the sensitivity of the limiting amplifier that follows the TIA.Circuit DesignThe 5Gbps optical system should have a maximum data frequency of 5Ghz and will require a TIA with at least 3.5Ghz bandwidth. This is to ensure minimum gain loss and distortion. As we learned in class, a single pole amplifier will continuously lose its gain with the increase of operation frequency. To define a range of operations, we used -3dB bandwidth and considered a 3dB gain reduction, and around -45 degree phase shift is acceptable.The bandwidth of our amplifier will be limited by the dominant pole. Therefore, with a frequency lower than or slightly higher than the bandwidth, the amplifier will behave like a single pole system. This means our amplifier will maintain its DC gain until the bandwidth of 3.5Ghz, then drop off at a rate of 20db per decade until the second pole. At 5Ghz, this system will have a gain reduction around (5Ghz-3.5Ghz)/5Ghz / 10 Gainer-dec * 20dB-per-dec = 3dB. As discussed previously, -3dB gain reduction still provides high enough gain to maintain signal-to-noise ratio and low enough phase shift to avoid pattern-dependent jitter.Overall DesignThe general structure of our design is made up of three stages. The first part is a common gate amplifier which isolates the input capacitance from the photodiode while still providing high transimpedance. The second part is a series of common source amplifiers that maintains the high bandwidth of the common gate amplifier and provides good amplification. The third buffer is a common drain amplifier that acts as a voltage buffer to provide enough output voltage. Fig 1. - General Structure of TIACommon Gate AmplifierIn order to tolerate the high input capacitance as well as transforming the current input to voltage output, the frontend of the circuit was designed to be a common gate (CG) amplifier. The basic common gate amplifier structure is shown below.$\\tau_{in} = C_{gs}(R_{sig} \\| 1/g_m)$$\\tau_{out}=(C_{gd}+C_L)R_L$$A_v = g_m R_D$Fig 2. - Basic Common Gate Amplifier General StructureOne of the problems when designing is finding the balance between the gain and bandwidth, while preventing forming a dominant pole between the CG amplifier and the next stage, the load resistance has to be relatively low. Therefore, the gain $g_m$ as well as the dimension of the transistor has to be high.The final common gate amplifier structure is shown in Fig 3. below. The CG amplifier(M1) uses a CS stage NMOS(M2) in replacement of the $R_{sig}$, in order to transform current input to voltage input and block the large pole from the 500fF input capacitance.A current mirror is built for the M1 and M2, reducing the difficulty of biasing. A resistor($R1_b$) in the structure below is used to design $I_{ref}$ for the stage. Finally, an inductor is introduced in series with M2, and in parallel with the input capacitance, forming a RLC loop for higher bandwidth. Fig 3. - Final Topology of the Common Gate AmplifierCommon Source AmplifierAiming to further enhance circuit gain in high frequency response, resistively loaded NMOS differential common source (CS) pairs have been applied as second part. The gain function of the differential amplifier is identical to the transfer function of the half circuit, which is the basic CS Amplifier shown in Fig 4. Tracking the signal from input to output. The following equation could be obtained. Under the restriction for frequency response and output voltage, $R_D$ and $\\frac{W}{L}$ are carefully selected as high as possible.$v_{in}=v_{sig}$$v_{gs}=v_{i}$$v_{o}=-g_m v_{sig} R_D$$A_{vo} \\equiv \\frac{v_o}{v_i}=-g_m R_D$$R_o=R_D$Fig 4. - Basic Common Source Amplifier General StructureThus, In the differential configuration of this CS stage, a CS NMOS (M2) is introduced as the current source, and a current mirror is built using M2_b and a resistor ($R_b$) to bias M2, providing desired $I_d$ for the CS amplifier stage. The $I_{ref}$ for this stage is defined by $R_b$ , and the current between the biasing branch ($I_b$) and main branch ($I_d$) is determined by the size ratio of M2_b and M2 shown in the following equation.$\\frac{W_{2b}}{W_2}=\\frac{I_{ref}}{I_d}$In this project, the ratio is set to be5 based on the following: $I_d$ enough for a high gain $g_m$ from M1, resulting in higher gain; and $I_{ref}$ can be relatively small to prevent large energy loss on the biasing resistor.Two cascaded CS stages are needed to obtain enough gain. However, bandwidth will witness a tradeoff at this point. While the GBW (gain-bandwidth product) maintains the same, the feedback resistance is connected between two cascade CS amplifiers to reach the desired bandwidth. To further increase the bandwidth, an inductor is introduced to the load of one stage. During testing, a larger gain is observed from the second stage (of two cascading stages), indicating a larger pole at its output. Therefore, the inductor is chosen to be placed at the second CS stage. The final topology of the entire 2nd stage is shown in Figure 5., and a detailed schematic of a single stage is shown in Figure 6.Fig 5. - Final Topology of the 2nd stage Fig 6. - Detailed Schematic of Common Source Amplifier StageCommon Drain AmplifierThe third stage is a common drain stage. It isolates the previous stages from directly connecting to the load, preventing its performance from being influenced during application. Tt also transforms the high output impedance from the second stage (amplifying stage) to an impedance matching the transmission line, which is 50 ohms. Last stage and $R_{source}$ act as the current mirror provides the desired $I_d$ for two stages. $R_{source}$ provides $I_{ref}$ for the third stage. Since $V_b$ doesn't significantly change, $I_{ref}$ remains similar. One of the important aspects to consider is the output impedance. The ratio of $I_{ref}$ and $I_d$ is determined by the size of $M_{1b}$ and $M_1$. $I_{ref}=\\frac{(V_{dd}-V_b)}{R_{source}}$$R_{out}=(g_{m1}+g_{ds1}+g_{ds2})^{-1}$$I_{ref}/I_d=W_{1b}/W_1$The final design is shown in Fig 7.

Twisted 2D materials(2DMs) can activate more Raman-inactive vibration modes. Therefore, an in-depth Raman spectroscopy research on twisted 2DMs is necessary to fully understand the properties of the materials. Moreover, the superlattice introduced by the twisted 2DMs causes the appearance of Moiré phonons,which means that Moiré have a modulating effect on phonon transport. Raman spectroscopy is the relatively simplest method to characterise this modulating effect. However, not all material systems have been studied in detail for their phonon vibration modes, and the physical mechanisms of Moiré phonons vibration have not been fully and comprehensively discussed, due to limitations in preparation techniques and experimental progress.This project has developed the following stable preparation process for materials where large area mechanical desorption is difficult to achieve: mechanical cleavage, followed by atomic force microscope cutting and dry transfer. This method is used for most 2D Materials that can be mechanically cleavage and allows the preparation of twisted 2D Materials samples with relatively small area. It could facilitate the Raman study of twistronics. What is more, this method does not require the aid of other 2D materials, allowing better study of the phonon vibration modes of the material itself.In this project, three twisted qualayer molybdenum telluride(MoTe2) with different rotation angles were successfully fabricated by using this process. The project also involved the measurement and analysis of the prepared samples by Raman spectroscopy, which led to the following conclusions: the degree of relative twisted angle is closely related to the Raman-shift of $A_1g$ and $B^1_{2g}$ mode.The relative rotation degree could be judged by Raman-shift of the peaks. According to the symmetry of the atomic arrangement and the data analysis, this paper predicts that the Raman-shift of these peaks will be exhibiting barely a\"V-shape\"behavior with the 30° as the symmetry axis within the twisted range of 1° to 59° . However, the current research results failed to find the new rise of vibration modes from moiré phonons.In response to the failure of observing Moiré phonon vibration modes, this paper also proposes improvements to both the preparation and measurement experiments. The results of the present tentative experiments are also shown in this paper. It is hoped that through these methodological improvements, it may be possible to observe the emergence of Moiré phonon vibrational modes and gain insight into the role the Moiré pattern plays in the modulation of phonons.By studying all the vibrational modes of the material, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the properties of this material and to provide information for the future devices fabrication. In addition, the study of the Moiré phonon vibration modes provides a clear understanding of the physical mechanisms. The ability of the Moiré pattern to modulate phonon transportation and the physical mechanism, helps develop the ”phonon engineering” and provides the possibility to prepare more outstanding performance devices.Keywords: Atomic Force Microscope Cutting; Raman Spectroscopy; Interlayer Phonon Vibration Mode; Moiré Phonon; Twisted Qualayer MoTe2Chapter 1: IntroductionTwo-dimentional materials (2D Materials) refer to crystalline solids consisting of a single layer of atoms. Since these materials have one less dimension than bulk materials, the excellent mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of 2D materials are far superior to those of bulk materials. Based on the excellent properties of 2D materials, the devices designed based on them also have excellent performance, with broad application prospects. 2D Materials are currently one of the hottest interests in academic research. 2D materials have a huge family of materials, and MoTe2 is one of them. This project mainly focuses on the Raman study of a special 2D material - Molybdenum Ditelluride (MoTe2), and its twisted samples.In this chapter, background, related work and research importance have been detaily explained.BackgroundIn 1965, Gordon Moore Gave a famous speech mentioning Moore’s Law, which became a prediction for the semiconductor industry. [1] However, as the device size continues to shrink, new physical problems brought by the small size also rise. “Heat death” and “quantum uncertainty” are two main problems. New devices based on new materials have become one of the important ways to solve the problem. Among them, 2D materials are one of the hottest research topics.Since the discovery of graphene in 2004 by Professor Jem and Professor Novoselov of the University of Manchester [2] , more 2D materials have been discovered and studied by scientists, and great progress has been made. According to the elemental composition, materials can be mainly divided into the graphene family, Xenes, chalcogenides, 2D oxides and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs).Since 2D materials have no interlayer interactions, single-layer or thin-layer 2D materials have less electronic confinement and have excellent electrical properties. At the same time, since the thickness of 2D materials is at the atomic level, which provides great mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, it is expected to become a new generation of optoelectronic devices for fabrication of high flexibility and transparency. Based on the excellent mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of 2D materials, the heterostructures by stacking different 2D materials can be applied to field effect transistors, diodes and other applications. [3] These applications may help solve problems encountered in bulk material-based devices. However, due to the huge family of 2D materials, different 2D materials-based structural characterizations and studies are not very detailed and thorough.Among these structures, a special heterostructure, the twisted structure, has made great progress in recent years and has attained high attention. The twisted structure is to replace the other 2D materials of the heterojunction with the same 2D material, and form different atomic arrangements through relative rotation, thereby changing the arrangement of atoms between different layers to form a heterostructure. The superlattice is formed because the upper and lower layers interact with each other due to the twisted mismatch of the two layers. In the superlattice, the physical properties of the material will change, and the energy band, transport properties and other properties can be regulated by controlling the degree of the relative angle. At the same time, the formation of moiré patterns and superlattices from the twisted structure introduces new physical properties, which have attracted the attention of researchers. There are several ways to characterize the twisted structure: Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, second harmonic research, and light absorption research. As a means to directly study the phonon-related properties of the material itself, Raman spectroscopy can reflect the crystal structure, symmetry, defects and impurities of the material itself. The characterization of the results of twisted 2D materials can enrich more phonon vibration modes, which is of great significance for understanding the properties of the materials themselves.Although the properties of the twisted structure of some materials such as graphene and twisted molybdenum sulfide have been fully studied, the studies in the twisted 2D materials which cannot be obtained by growth methods and obtained with small area by mechanical cleavage are still incomplete. Limited by the single layer preparation method, the development of a small-area-friendly 2D material twisted preparation method is particularly important in the sustainable development of the twisted structure. The focus of this project has developed a process that can relatively stably prepare small-area 2D twisted samples. The structure is characterized by Raman Spectroscopy, and its phonon mode is studied, so as to fully understand the influence of the twisted stacking on the atomic lattice. The Moiré pattern is also studied in its effect on the phonon and its vibration modes.Based on the study of the phonon vibration modes under the twisted structure, we can understand the effect of Moiré patterns on phonons while better understanding this material. According to the relevant work, the phonon transport capacity under the superlattice will be improved. By using this method to prepare more 2D twisted structures, it is beneficial to understand the regulation of Moiré patterns on phonon transport under the same material system or under different material systems. Based on the generation of Moiré patterns and the physical mechanism, it is possible to develop \"phonon engineering\" because it might help solve the \"heat depth\" problem by controlling the carrier of heat - phonon.Related WorkThe development of twisted structureThis section briefly reviews and summarizes the development history of twisted structure research and the physical phenomena under beneath. Then, this section will focus on the 2D materials that are currently more deeply studied by Raman spectroscopy, starting with twisted graphene, and representative materials of twisted TMDCs. . The development status of MoS2 and other 2D material systems is summarized.The earliest research began with twisted graphene. The researchers found that the atoms in the upper and lower layers of naturally occurring or artificially synthesized highly oriented pyrolytic graphite usually undergo dislocation and rotation to form a superlattice [4;5] . Scientists began to think about whether the appearance of superlattices and changes in the stacking method would have an impact on the energy bands of graphene, and conducted theoretical and experimental studies. However, the area of the relative angle is very small at this time, which restricts the study of Moiré patterns to be observed only by scanning tunneling microscopy without looking into optical properties and mechanical properties.With the development of twisted preparation technology, the area of the twisted structure is getting larger and larger, making more characterization methods possible. At the same time, advances in characterization methods have also enabled more material information to be observed. For example, the researchers proposed that the Moiré patterns will generate a periodic potential, which can enable electrons to interact with each other, resulting in various special physical phenomena with excellent performance. This idea is based on the experimental observation that twisted bilayer graphene produces a Moiré flat band due to its extremely strong interlayer coupling, and the velocity on Dirac point passes through zero several times as the twisted decreases [6] . This phenomenon fully illustrates the electrical regulation of Moiré patterns. According to the latest research results, twisted three-layer twisted graphene has stronger electronic structure tunability and superconductivity than double-layer graphene, and the existence of this superconductivity and superlattice simultaneously appear as two current carriers It is caused by the phase of the broken symmetry, which is confined to the van der Waals singularity. The findings also suggest that twisted trilayer twisted graphene can be electrically tuned to move closer to the Bose-Einstein condensation, or break the understanding of strongly coupled superconductivity. [7] The development of preparation and characterization technology has made the research materials no longer limited to twisted graphene, and the main topic is not only focused on electrical properties, but also optical properties. For direct bandgap semiconductor TMDCs with strong light-matter interaction, the twisted structure of the TMDCs also produces moiré potential, which produces moiré excitons in optical properties. [8] Based on the Raman-inactive hexagonal boron nitride can be excited through the interlayer coupling of the heterostructure composed of tungsten selenide and hexagonal boron nitride, the Raman peak activity is speculated. [9] This led the researchers to question whether this activation also exists in the twisted structure.Compared with the heterostructures composed of 2D materials with different lattice sizes, the lattice structure of the twisted bilayer has greater periodic symmetry, and the period of its crystal superlattice depends on the relative rotation angle. Due to the phonon folding effect of the superlattice, the folded acoustic and optical phonons should be observed by Raman spectroscopy. At the same time, the interlayer coupling in the twisted-structured superlattice also induces a periodic potential that can generate additional phonons, which can be understood by Raman spectroscopy. The twisted bilayer structure is the simplest prototype to understand the basic properties of the heterostructure, so the Raman characterization and research of the twisted structure are of great significance. [10] At the same time, Raman characterization is beneficial to understand the crystal structure, symmetry, defects and impurities of the material itself, so as to further understand the properties of the material itself. It's also beneficial to apply to different applications based on it.In addition to Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) measurements are also commonly used to characterize optical properties. According to the literature, the controllable twisted graphene light absorption compared with Bernal stack/AB stacked bilayer graphene, the efficiency of light absorption is about 35%, from the original 4.6% to about 6.2%. [11] According to a study in 2014, in the PL spectra of the twisted molybdenum sulfide samples, the PL peaks associated with the electronic coupling within the layer vary greatly under the modulation of the twisted angle. Although the research progresses on the twisted structure in 2019, a new physical concept - moiré exciton rises. This is closely related to the Moiré potential mentioned above, which affects the electronic coupling within the layer. [12] At present, the research on light absorption, PL spectrum, and SHG is still studied.Development of Twisted GrapheneAccording to the current study, twisted graphene belongs to the system of bilayer breathing mode. Since the superlattice exhibits a θ-dependent orientation, a new long acoustic branch is excited in the Brillouin zone, which can be measured by first-order Raman scattering. It is worth noting that there are some similarities and differences between the first-order Raman measurement and the second-order Raman measurement.According to the Raman measurement of different twisted bilayer graphene, as shown in Figure 1.1., the formation of a superlattice will cause the following R peaks in the Raman measurement, which are highlighted with \"*\" in the figure. Curves with different colors represent excitation light at different wavelengths. Red, green, and blue represent: 633 nm, 514 nm, and 488 nm, respectively. Black is the peak position of silicon itself. By observing these new R peaks, it can be concluded that the superlattice activates the phonons inside the Brillouin zone, and the relative rotation angle θ will determine the wave vector, enabling modulation. Different vibrational peaks correspond to different phonon branches. [13] Fig 1.1 - First-order Raman spectroscopy of twisted graphene [13] For second-order Raman systems, the 2D peak (G' peak) can only be activated if there are defects in the graphene system. Its frequency depends on the excitation light wavelength, and is very sensitive to changes in the band structure of electrons and phonons, so the vibrational mode characterization of twisted graphene can be carried out through this vibrational mode. [14] According to Kim's research, the Full width at half maximum(FWHM), center wavelength of the 2D peaks all change with θ, as shown in Figure 1-2. [15] Fig 1.2 - Second-order Raman Spectroscopy of twisted graphene [15] The researchers also studied the double vibration modes of the twisted graphene, and came to the following conclusions: (1)the phonons in the valley are concentrated at the Γ point, while the phonon of double resonance outside the valley is near the K point;(2)the wave vectors of the different phonons of the double resonance Raman both are concentrated at the Γ point and K point of high symmetry; (3)under different excitation energies of light, the wave vector of the double resonance will change;(4)under the double resonance Raman, the defect peak needs to be activated to appear. [16] In the latest twisted Raman research, the researchers based on the principle that the electronic energy level structure of twisted graphene can achieve a low-energy Van Hove singularity through layer coupling. By adjusting the stacking angle of the twisted graphene, thereby modulating the third-order optical nonlinearity. Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) efficiency is greatly improved when the energy gap of the van Hove singularity matches the three-phonon resonance frequency of the incident light. Compared with the modulation of single-layer graphene, the efficiency of gate-controlled THG is enhanced by 60 times, and it has broad application prospects in tunable nonlinear optical devices. [17] Phonon mode study of twisted molybdenum sulfide(MoS2)For twisted 2D materials, due to the phonon folding effect of the superlattice, Raman spectroscopy can observe the positions of the acoustic branch and the optical branch after folding. The appearance of a superlattice also introduces a Moiré potential to the interactions within the layers. According to the study of the twisted MoS2 by the Pingheng Tan's group, since this potential is not strong enough to form a new lattice-matched structure, the two wave vectors of the monolayer molybdenum sulfide will fold to the regional center Γ in the Moiré inverted space point. These phonons will become Raman active and new vibrational modes will appear. According to the symmetry of the atomic crystal arrangement, the Raman frequency shift center position change curve of these folded peaks should be a \"V\"-shaped curve with 30° as the symmetry axis. But it is worth noting that the coupling of the shear modes in the layers is not enough to make new changes in the shear modes in the layers. At the same time, in order to distinguish the new mode caused by Moiré phonons from the peaks related to the second-order Raman, the study also characterized the samples using Raman systems with different wavelengths, and found that when the excitation wavelength is close to the C excitons, the Moiré sound The intensity of the sub-correlated vibrational modes will be greatly improved. This fully demonstrates that the excitation of the Moiré phonon vibrational mode is generated by the exciton effect.Fig 1.3 -Twisted MoS2 Raman spectroscopy [18] The latest research on twisted MoS2 has investigated small angles, whose Raman spectra are shown in Figures 1.3. According to the difference of Raman spectra, it can be divided into three regions: Relaxed Regime (0◦ ≤ θ &lt; 2◦), Rigid Regime (θ ≥6◦) and Tradition Regime (2◦ ≤ θ &lt; 6◦). Based on the symmetry, researchers speculate that these regions, phonons, will be renormalized. Near-field scanning presents challenges for the limitations of current scanning tunneling microscopy techniques. Then in the transition region, Raman spectroscopy can observe continuous, faint changes in atomic configuration and strain. This provides a new method for the study of material properties. [18] Phonon Vibratoin Mode of other twisted 2D materials ResearchIn addition to the two materials mentioned above, the research on the twisted structure of 2D materials such as tungsten selenide(WSn), tin diselenide(SnSe2), and tungsten disulfide(WS2) is the research object. According to the new study, low wavenumber measurements of twisted WSn can be used as a criterion for judging favorable relative angles of twisted samples. The central wavelength of the breathing mode shifts significantly with the change of angle. Its moving trend also takes 30° as the axis of symmetry, forming a symmetrical curve. In the range of 5° to 7°, the interlayer breathing pattern changes showed a clear angular dependence. But the blue-shift of the breathing mode only lasted to ∼14°, while the Raman frequency shift of the post-breathing mode remained almost unchanged. [19] Reserch proposal and importanceRaman spectroscopy is a powerful characterization method for the study of phonon vibrational modes in 2D materials. Although some 2D materials, such as graphene, MoS2 and other twisted structures have gradually deepened, the physical mechanism for the generation of \"Moiré phonons\" has not yet been unified. Therefore, it is necessary to study and discuss different material systems and unify their related physical mechanisms. For some 2D materials that are difficult to grow a single layer, the Raman research is still in its infancy, and MoTe2 is one of the 2D materials.Compared with well-grown 2D materials such as sulfide and selenide, the atomic mass of the tellurium atom in MoTe2 is larger, and the phonon vibration mode is quite different from it. In order to understand all the phonon vibrational modes of MoTe2 and the Moiré phonons associated with MoTe2, a Raman study was performed on twisted MoTe2. In the selection of the number of MoTe2 layers, because the single-layer MoTe2 is easily oxidized at high temperature, and the transfer process needs to experience high temperature, this project selects a relatively stable and photoelectric property comparable to the single-layer MoTe2. Double-layer MoTe2 was used as the research object.The monolayer or thin layer of MoTe2 can only be obtained by mechanical cleavage, but due to its crystal size limitation and strong interlayer interaction, the obtained monolayer 2D material has only one side or only one side. ten microns. Its thin layer size greatly limits the fabrication of twisted structures, posing challenges to the continued development of twisted structures.Aiming at this situation, this paper develops a method for the preparation of small-area twisted 2D structure samples through mechanical cleavage, which is friendly to experiments where the upper and lower cladding layers interfere with the measurement. This method includes three processes: mechanical cleavage, atomic force microscope cutting, and dry transfer. These three processes and other methods are discussed in depth in this paper. With this method, the project prepared three twisted MoTe2 samples and carried out Raman spectroscopy measurement and data analysis. Through the characterization of the twisted samples, we can understand the phonon vibration mode of the twisted MoTe2, and better understand its crystal structure, symmetry and other material properties. This method is effective for most twisted sample preparations where thin layers can be obtained by mechanical cleavage.In the follow-up experiments, based on the reflection on the measurement results, this project also conducted a tentative experiment to improve the experiment. In this paper, in addition to non-damaging and localized surface cleaning methods for 2D materials, an atomic force microscopy method for enhancing interlayer interactions and a thermal annealing method are proposed. Through these methods, the quality of the prepared twisted samples is continuously improved to better and comprehensively study the phonon vibration modes of the twisted samples.Chapter 2: Twisted MoTe2 Fabrication ProcessSince the beginning of twisted research, the sample preparation of twisted 2D material has mainly been through the growth of twisted 2D material structures, or assisted by other 2D materials. The development of this project is aimed at the twisted preparation method of small-area 2D materials that can only be prepared by mechanical cleavage without the assistance of other 2D materials. In the first section of this chapter, the paper introduces the mechanical cleavage, and briefly explains and compares it with other methods. The second section explains the AFM cutting method in detail. Using this cutting method, the same thin-layer sample can be cut into two parts while retaining a larger area of ​​the sample without other 2D materials assistance. The principle, process and cutting effect will be shown in this section. Other commonly used cutting methods will also be described. The advantages and disadvantages of each method will be compared and analyzed. Dry transfer is the final step in the preparation of the twisted sample structure in this project and will be described in detail in the third session of this chapter. By dry transfer, the cut samples are stacked into twisted structure samples to complete the preparation of the twisted structure. The principle, process and preparation results of dry transfer will be demonstrated in this section. In addition, other transfer methods will also be briefly summarized in this section.Monolayer ExfoliationIn order to prepare the twisted samples, obtaining a thin layer sample is the first step of the experiment. In this section, various ways to obtain thin layers of 2D materials will be introduced, and the mechanical cleavage method used in this project will be described in detail.Related ultra-thin layer fabrication techniquesThere are a variety of techniques to obtain ultra-thin layers, including cleavage, liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, wet chemical synthesis. [3]The earliest and common method for preparing thin layers of 2D materials started from mechanical cleavage. It utilizes that the interaction between the adhesive tape and the 2D material is greater than the interlayer van der Waals force between the 2D materials to achieve thinning, and finally the sheet is transferred to the target substrate. This method can obtain relatively high-quality samples, but the yield is relatively low and extremely random. [2] Liquid exfoliation is also a traditional method. Ultra-thin sample is attained by using ultrasound by placing the bulk crystals in Dimethylfor-Mamide (DMF) or N-Methyl-Pyrrolidone (NMP). This method utilizes the ultrasonic energy to destroy the van der Waals forces between the layers to achieve thinning of the material. This method enables relatively low-cost, high-yield fabrication of ultrathin 2D materials, but due to the toxicity of these organic solvents, there are high requirement for production equipment. Meantime, these organic solvents will remain on the 2D material, affecting the properties of the subsequent preparation of the 2D material device. [20] The ion exfoliation method is to obtain thin-layer samples by embedding organic metal compounds in the interlayer space of bulk crystals to reduce the interlayer interaction force. This approach enables precise control of ion intercalation for efficient thinning. However, since the experimental process needs to last for a long time at high temperature, and the organometallic compounds may explode if exposed to oxygen and water, the preparation process is relatively cumbersome. [21] Chemical vapor deposition growth is to generate precursors by reacting the substrate under high temperature and high vacuum conditions, and then the precursors react and/or decompose on the surface of the substrate, thereby forming large-area ultra-thin 2D materials. This method can obtain relatively high-quality, large-area 2D materials with controllable size and thickness, and excellent performance. At present, this method is one of the important methods to obtain thin-layer 2D materials.Wet chemical synthesis is also one of the commonly used thin-layer synthesis methods. This method synthesizes target materials from certain precursors through chemical reactions in solution, enabling the synthesis of controllable size, shape, and morphology. This method enables high-yield, large-scale growth of 2D materials. But this method is difficult to obtain monolayer samples.Although chemical vapor deposition growth and chemical synthesis have the advantages of high yield and large area, they also have limitations: not all 2D materials can be grown by these methods. At present, many materials with twisted structures are grown based on chemical vapor deposition methods, and the stacking of thin-layer sample twisteds is realized by two growths directly by controlling the growth conditions. For the rest of 2D materials, they can only be obtained by mechanical exfoliation. This project mainly uses this material. For MoTe2, it is difficult to obtain by growth and synthesis methods, and ion exfoliation and wet exfoliation cause great lattice damage to MoTe2, which is easily oxidized. Currently, monolayer can be only obtained by mechanical exfoliation.Mechanical Cleavage ProcessMechanical cleavage mainly includes the following processes: Place the bulk crystal on the tape for thinning; Continue to fold and paste in half to further thinning; Transfer the sample that may have a thin layer to the target substrate; Look for thin layer samples on the substrate;Through this method, the thinning of thick samples of 2D materials is realized, and samples of target thickness are obtained.Layer Number ClassificationThe layer samples need to be identified. There are three commonly used methods: optical microscope, atomic force microscope(AFM), and Raman spectroscopy.The optical microscope judges layers' number based on reflection lights as different layers have different deflection ability. Judging by the color represented by the wavelength of scattered light, which can tell the approximate numbers. The increasing layers corresponding to color change from light purple, blue, green, yellow, and red.AFM uses the interaction of microneedles with the surface to record the position of the tip, thereby recording the topography of the surface of the sample. By comparing the relative height of the substrate and the surface of the sample, the height measurement is realized, so as to calculate the number of layers of the sample.Raman spectroscopy is also a common method for judging the number of layers. The principle is to use 2D materials of different layers, and the interaction between layers is different, which is manifested as changes in Raman vibration peaks, that is, new Raman peaks, displacement or splitting of some characteristic peaks, etc.In the project, an optical microscope is the main way to measure layer number, supplemented by the measurement of Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy.NanolithographyIn order to ensure the same crystal orientation of the upper and lower layers of materials before transfer and the consideration of preparation efficiency, the best preparation method of the twisted structure is that the upper and lower layers are from the same thin-layer sample. Although the transfer method may break the material sample, the preparation of small-area twisted samples requires a more precise and stable cutting method due to the inability to control where the edge contacts the sample during transfer.Related WorkIn order to ensure that the angle of the rotating structure can be precisely controlled, the two samples of the twisted sample should keep the same crystal orientation before stacking. For the isotropic samples through mechanical cleavage, only the two-layer twisted samples are from the same single-layer or thin-layer sample, and the relative rotation of the upper and lower samples can be ensured by the relative twisted movement and transfer processing. The relative angle produced by the two layers of atoms is consistent with the macroscopic rotation angle. Therefore, the development of 2D material cutting technology is an inevitable subject for the preparation of twisted structures. At present, for samples obtained by mechanical cleavage, there are mainly the following cutting methods: assisted cutting of other 2D materials, laser cutting, atomic force microscopy cutting.In 2017, Yuan Cao and other researchers developed a \"tear and stack\" method, using hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) to assist the preparation of twisted graphene. Since the lattice structure and size of hBN and graphene are similar, the interaction force between the two is extremely strong. The force is greater than the force between graphene and the substrate, so that part of the sample is lifted. At the same time, due to the thin thickness of graphene, it is easy to produce wrinkles in direct contact with the PC film, so the hBN on the top layer can keep the graphene on the lower layer flat and play a protective role. [22] Laser cutting is also a commonly used cutting method. Using a high-power, concentrated laser to irradiate the sample, the energy of the photons causes the sample to be burned at a high temperature in a short period of time to achieve cutting. [23] In addition, the researchers have developed a method of cutting samples using atomic force microscopy, also known as Atomic Force Microscope Nanolithography. This method is based on the direct mechanical impact of a sharp atomic force microscope probe on the sample surface, so that the pressure of the probe tip on the surface is sufficient to cause deformation of the sample surface. The pressure applied to the sample can be controlled by the electric current passing through the atomic force microscope to realize the cutting of the sample. Similar is the way microneedles cut samples of 2D materials. This method also utilizes the mechanical impact force between the needle and the surface of the sample to cut the sample. [24] Each of the above methods has pros and cons. For the hBN-assisted dicing method, hBN as a cladding does play a protective role to air-sensitive 2D materials. However, because hBN is stacked on top and bottom, when measuring the interlayer interaction of the twisted sample, the interlayer interaction between hBN and other 2D materials will be introduced, which may cause new vibration modes to be excited. For the laser cutting method, due to the small area of some 2D materials, and the laser cut may be up to 5 microns in size, for these thin-layer samples whose size is only about 10 to 20 microns on a single side, it will cause a great loss of area, creating greater challenges for both preparation and subsequent measurements. Moreover, laser cutting may damage the lattice of the sample, which will affect the quality of the twisted sample. In contrast, AFM's incisions can be smaller than 1 micron, enabling precise, localized cuts. At the same time, the method of AFM can not introduce other 2D materials, avoid the introduction of new vibration modes, and affect the performance characterization of materials.Comparing the above three methods, AFM cutting is the best solution for this project.AFM NanolithographyThe AFM probe used for AFM cutting is dedicated to the contact mode. The sample is cut with the appropriate force using the harder needle. In this way, localized, relatively small incision cutting of 2D materials can be achieved. The specific operations are shown as follows: Measure the force constant of the probe; Scan the local topography of the sample and design the cutting shape; Set the appropriate contact force to let the microneedle cut the sample in the contact mode; Clean up the residual cut material on the microneedles; Use the probe to scan the part of the sample to check the cutting effect.In this project, a clear understanding of the amount of force used for cutting is important to develop a stable technique. According to Hooke's law $F = k * \\Delta Z$, the contact force of the probe is only proportional to the perpendicularity of the probe relative to the sample surface. In this project, in order to understand the magnitude of the force required to cut a single layer of MoTe2, we have carried out several test experiments, and the experimental parameters are summarized in the table below. Number Force constant k(N/m) Relative height δZ(nm) Force F(nN) Success or not 1 2.793 - 80.95 226.0934 No 2 3.157 -94.1 297.0737 No 3 4.03 -80 322.4000 Yes 4 4.879 -80.95 394.9551 Yes 5 3.157 -174.6 551.2122 No 6 4.879 -116.4 567.9156 Yes 7 4.879 -118.3 577.1857 Yes 8 3.157 -196.3 619.7191 Yes 9 3.157 -204.97 647.0903 Yes 10 4.879 -136.8 667.4472 Yes Based on the measured results, a minimum of 560 nN is required to cut monolayer, bilayer samples. To ensure a stable sample, cutting with a force of at least 600 nN or more is required. However, according to the current experimental results, the greater the force used, the larger the incision of the 2D material. The smoothness of the edge is affected by two factors: cutting force and cutting speed.It is worth noting that since the force constants of different needles are quite different, and it may change slightly before and after cutting, it is necessary to re-fit. The relative height ΔZ is set to ensure stable cutting of 2D materials. During the scanning process, the semi-contact mode is selected according to the characteristics of the needle to scan the topography of the sample. Failure to select too large a parameter in contact mode may result in the entire sample being pushed away by the probe.Nanolithograthy SamplesIn the experiment, different single-layer samples and double-layer samples are cut. The following figure shows the comparison of the samples before and after cutting by AFM. For ease of reading, the edges are marked with red lines in the following figure.Fig 2.1 - Comparison before and after MoTe2 cutted by AFM From this, it can be observed that this cutting method is stable and the incision is extremely small.Transfer TechniquesIn order to realize the stacking of 2D materials, the stacking of stacked structures can be realized by various transfer methods. This section will summarize the existing transfer methods and explain the main reasons for choosing dry transfer. Then, this section will detail the dry transfer process and show the twisted samples prepared in this project.Trasfer Techniques and their comparisonTo achieve the stacking of 2D materials, researchers need to transfer the samples. At present, there are the following transfer methods: dry transfer, wet transfer, heat release tape transfer, vacuum hot pressing transfer, bubbling transfer.The dry transfer method utilizes physical adsorption. It is based on the principle that the interaction force between the polymer and the 2D material is greater than that between the 2D material and the substrate. This method can achieve accurate stacking of samples and transfer without contamination to the surface of the samples, which is the requirement of this project for the higher surface cleanness of 2D materials and the accuracy of sample stacking.In addition to dry transfer, wet transfer, thermal release tape transfer and other methods are also commonly used. Wet transfer utilizes methods that can directly corrode the substrate or polymer solution-assisted transfer to achieve low-cost, large-area transfer. However, this method was not suitable for this project due to its tendency to wrinkle and the cracked polymer to be difficult to remove. The heat-release tape transfer method takes advantage of the strong adsorption force between the metal film and the 2D material, and uses the heat-release tape to quickly pick up the 2D sample. Although the impurities in the transfer process of thermal release tape are far less than those of wet transfer, it is not the best choice for this project due to the complicated operation process. The thermal release tape can also be used in vacuum hot pressing, layer-by-layer stacking can be realized in a vacuum system, and a large-area multi-layer heterojunction can be prepared. However, due to the introduction of too many difficult-to-remove polymers on the surface of the 2D material, this method is not suitable for this project, which also requires high surface cleanliness.In addition, some researchers use electrochemical or ultrasonic to generate bubble collapse force to separate the material from the substrate. The device is simple, but it is easy to fold or even rupture. It is also not the best option for this project, either. [25] To sum up, this project adopts the stacking of twisted structures by dry transfer which can achieve precise transfer and less contamination on the sample surface. Among them, dry transfer is classified according to the transfer tool, and there are three main methods: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), Polycarbonate (PC) and Polypropylene carbonate (Poly Propylene Carbonate, PPC) and PDMS assembly. Since the MoTe2 sample is very easy to oxidize, the oxidized sample cannot be separated from the substrate by ordinary transfer methods. Therefore, in order to improve the success rate of the transfer, the high temperature needs to be raised in a short time during the transfer process. This requires the stability of the film used in the transfer process, so this project uses PDMS and PC with the highest stability as the pick-up tool for transfer.Dry Transfer ProcessIn the dry transfer process, we need to prepare a pick-up tool for the transfer process. The pick-up tool is mainly composed of PDMS dicing, PC film, double-sided tape, and glass slide. The preparation process is as follows: Cut a PDMS cubic and place it on the slide; Place the PDMS block in it with double-sided tape with holes of the same size as the PDMS; Use a blue tape with a hole slightly larger than the size of PDMS to stick the PC film; Align the holes of the single-sided tape with the holes on the double-sided tape as much as possible, so that the PC and PDMS are closely attached; Verify the quality of the pick-up tool by heating at 120℃ for a few seconds; Observe if there is comtamination under a microscope;A high-quality pick-up tool is produced in this way, and a robust transfer can be achieved. Figure 2-2 shows a cross-sectional view of the pick tool.Fig 2.2 - Pick up tool cross-sectional viewAfter the pick-up tool is prepared, the sample is transferred using the pick-up tool and transfer equipment. The process is as follows: Use the optical photos of the sample to design the twisted structure Find the sample under the microscope, compare the design, and use the pick-up tool to pick up and place by heating and cooling many times; After stacking the samples, use high temperature to melt the PC film and separate it from PDMS. Wash the PC membrane with chloroform to complete the whole transfer process.Fig 2.3 - Transfer ProcessAccording to the design requirements, repeat steps three and four to complete the stacking of the 2D structure. The fabrication process is shown in Fig 2.3. Figure (a) shows the pick-up tool ready to pick up the upper MoTe2 layer. Figure (b) shows the pick-up tool successfully picking up the upper MoTe2 sample, adjusting the position according to the design, and preparing to pick up the lower MoTe2 sample. Figure (c) shows that the upper and lower layers of MoTe2 are in contact, and the twisted MoTe2 sample is successfully prepared. Figure (d) shows the final step: the PC film is separated from the pick-up tool, leaving the sample on the substrate.It is worth noting that since MoTe2 is easily sampled, it is sensitive to temperature, and it is necessary to always pay attention to whether it is oxidized during the transfer process. If oxidized, MoTe2 interacts strongly with the silica substrate, making sample transfer impossible by this method.Twisted MoTe2 SamplesThe following figure shows some twisted qualayer MoTe2 Samples with 29° and 45°. taken under microscope. Red is the overlapping part of the twisted area, and yellow is the non-overlapping part. Compared with the design drawings, these samples can basically be prepared for twisted samples according to the original design. These twisted samples can be as small as 5 microns per side.Fig 2.4 - Pick up tool cross-sectional viewChapter 3: Ramam Spectroscopy Charaterization and AnalysisThis chapter mainly focuses on Raman spectroscopy. In the first section of this chapter, the development and basic principles of Raman spectroscopy will be explained in detail, and redefine some of the concepts used in this paper based on these basic knowledge. The second section will give a detailed description of the Raman spectroscopy conditions and test results of the twisted structure of this project. In the third section of this chapter, the Raman test results of the twisted samples are analyzed and the conclusions are obtained. Finally, before the end of this chapter, this paper will organize and summarize the experiments of Raman spectroscopy.Raman effect and Raman spectroscopyIn 1928, Indian physicist Chandrasekara Raman discovered that the frequency of light waves changed after being scattered again, that is, photons undergo inelastic scattering, which was later named the Raman effect or Raman Scattering. There are two main types of Raman scattering - Stokes scattering and non-Stokes scattering. After the photon transitions from the ground state to the virtual state, the molecule emits a photon to the new energy level because this state is unstable. If the molecule returns to a higher energy level, the emitted photon has less energy, that is, has a longer wavelength than the incident photon, and the vibrational energy of the molecule increases, which is called Stokes Raman scattering. If the molecule returns to a lower energy level, the emitted photon has a larger energy, that is, a shorter wavelength than the incident photon, and the vibrational energy of the molecule decreases, which is called non-Stokes Raman scattering. And if the molecule can return to its original vibrational energy level, then the photon it emits has the same energy as the incident photon, that is, the same wavelength. At this point, no energy is transferred to the molecule, which is Rayleigh scattering. This project mainly explores Stokes scattering.The function graph of Raman scattering intensity versus wavelength becomes a Raman spectrum, and the abscissa is the wave number (Raman frequency shift) relative to the wavelength of the excitation light, and the wave number is the reciprocal of the wavelength. The Raman shift in wavenumber is calculated as follows:$Raman Shift(cm^{-1})=\\frac{1}{excited \\ wavelength nm (\\frac{1.0 cm}{10^7 cm})}-\\frac{1}{scatter \\ wavelength nm (\\frac{1.0 cm}{10^7 cm})}$ The Stokes Raman intensity is proportional to the number of molecules in the lowest energy state, while the anti-Stokes Raman intensity is proportional to the number of molecules in the next highest vibrational energy level. According to $\\frac{N_1}{N_0}=\\frac{g_1}{g_0}exp[-(\\Delta E)/KT]$, in the state of thermal equilibrium, the number of molecules in the low vibrational mode energy level is always greater than the number of molecules in the next highest vibrational energy level, so the Stokes Raman intensity is always greater than the anti-Stokes Raman intensity, and its intensity is relatively satisfactory the following formula:$\\frac{I_{Stokes}}{I_{Anti-Strokes}}=\\frac{(\\vec{v}_o-\\vec{v}_M)^4}{(\\vec{v}_o+\\vec{v}_M)^4}exp(\\frac{hc\\vec{v}_o}{k_BT})$ Fig 3.1 - (a) shows the schematic diagram of the energy level transition of Rayleigh scattering, Stokes scattering, and anti-Stokes scattering (b) is the comparison diagram of the frequency shift and intensity corresponding to the scattering caseFigure 3-1 shows the schematic diagram of different scattering energy level transitions in the material and the corresponding frequency shift and intensity comparison diagram. The main research in this project is Stokes Raman scattering. It is worth noting that the wavenumber has the following relationship with the excited energy: $E=hv=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}=hc\\omega$ , that is, the Raman frequency shift is a measure of the vibrational energy, and the Raman frequency shift can reflect different vibrational energies (quantized vibrations energy levels) to distinguish different vibrational modes (discontinuities exhibited by Raman scattering spectra). [26] With Raman spectroscopy, we can further characterize material properties. In this project, by understanding the Raman spectrum of the twisted structure, the changes of the vibrational modes displayed by the spectrum is paid attention to for understanding the changes in the atomic arrangement caused by the twisted structure. By characterizing the vibration mode changes caused by the rotation angle, the Raman spectrum changes corresponding to different angles can be inferred, and a deeper understanding of the material can be obtained.Raman spectroscopy of twisted 2D structuresTo characterize the twisted structure of 2D structures, Raman spectroscopy is a commonly used means. Since the twisted structure destroys the original symmetry of the material, the resulting phonon vibrations associated with the interlayer vibrational modes will produce new changes. The change is mainly manifested in the peak position, FWHM and the ratio between different peaks of the twisted structure. By comparing the Raman spectra of the two-layer MoTe2 sample and the four-layer MoTe2 sample, we can understand the changes of the Raman spectra of the twisted structure. Combined with the correlation between Raman spectra and phonon vibrational modes, we can understand the influence of different rotation angles on the interlayer interaction force, and form a one-to-one correspondence between Raman spectra and rotation angles, which becomes the \"fingerprint\" of twisted MoTe2.Based on all conditions, this project uses green light with a wavelength of 633 nm to measure the sample. During the measurement, because MoTe2 is sensitive, too high power can cause damage to the sample and oxidize the sample. In order to avoid it, combined with the measurement power mentioned in the literature, the measurement power used in this project is 0.1 mW, and the total time of a single integration is 30 seconds.The measurement data is shown in Fig 3.2.Fig 3.2 - Raman spectra of double-layer, four-layer, 15◦, 29◦, 45◦ twisted samples at 633nm wavelength lightsA total of nine characteristic peaks were measured, and their peak positions were $~138cm^{-1}$, $~171cm^{-1}$, $~138cm^{-1}$, $~ 205cm^{-1}$, $~235cm^{-1}$, $~291cm^{-1}$, $~306cm^{-1}$, $~329cm^{-1}$, $~345cm^{-1}$, these peak positions are similar to those mentioned in the literature. Among them, the two split peaks of $~171cm^{-1}$ correspond to the $A_{1g}$ vibrational mode, which is the mode generated by the relative motion of the molybdenum and tellurium atoms between the upper and lower layers, as shown in Figure 3-3(a) below. The atomic vibrational model for this vibrational mode is clearly demonstrated in , both in terms of the number of layers and the magnitude of the angle. $~235cm^{-1}$ corresponds to the $E^1_{2g}$ peak, which is the interlayer vibrational mode, shown in Figure 3-3(b) below, which represents the motion of the tellurium and molybdenum atoms in the layer, the number of layers and the angle Less affected. $~291cm^{-1}$ represents the $E^1_{2g}$ peak, which is caused by the relative motion of molybdenum and tellurium atoms in the interlayer. The peak position of this characteristic peak is also related to the number of layers and the size of the angle. For $~306cm^{-1}$ the peaks are characteristic of silicon, non-twisted samples or characteristic peaks associated with MoTe2 material. According to the reviewed literature, the remaining five peaks are vibration peaks corresponding to the double resonance Raman of the twisted MoTe2.Fig 3.3 - in-plane (a) and out-of-plane (b) optical phonon modes of four-layer MoTe2 [27] In order to study the vibrational modes between the different peaks in more detail, a local amplification analysis of the Raman spectrum was performed. According to the figure, the situation of the $A_{1g}$ peak can be seen more clearly. Splitting occurs in the fourth layer of $A_{1g}$, while the second layer has a larger half width. The relative peak positions of the twisted bilayer samples show double peaks or \"shoulders\", which fully indicates that the MoTe2 in the upper and lower layers of the twisted bilayer structure has interlayer interactions, and the twisted structure samples were successfully prepared. At the same time, the $A_{1g}$ peak of the twisted structure is very different from that of the four-layer sample, which indicates that the relative rotation angle of the upper and lower two-layer samples has a great influence on the interaction between the layers.Observing Figure 3.4., comparing the A_{1g} peaks of the five samples, the second layer is a relatively broad peak at $173.6cm^{-1}$, while the fourth peak is split, and the peak positions are located at $171.7cm^{-1}$ and $174cm^{-1}$, respectively. The wavenumbers of the double peaks differ by about $3cm^{-1}$. The two untreated peaks are basically consistent with the bilayer and trilayer peak positions of about $173cm^{-1}$, $171cm^{-1}$ and $173cm^{-1}$ in the literature. These differences may be caused by the measurement system itself, and this difference is acceptable.Fig 3.4 - $A_{1g}$ peak of double-layer, qua-layer, 15◦, 29◦, 45◦ twisted samples at 633nm wavelength lightsComparing the twisted sample with the qua-layer sample and the double-layer sample, it can be found that the spectrum of the twisted sample is more similar to the Raman spectrum of the qua-layer sample, which indicates that the two layers of MoTe2 on the upper and lower layers of the twisted structure have produced interlayer interactions, the qua-layer sample of the twisted was successfully stacked. However, there is a big difference in the splitting of the $A_{1g}$ peak between the spectrum of the twisted sample and the qua-layer sample. For the 15° and 45° samples, since the lattice symmetry period is 30° − θ, the lattice periodicity should be the same at these two angles, and the Raman peak position and full width at half maximum should be similar. Experimental measurements fit this prediction. At the same time, this peak is mainly composed of two peaks. Under different rotation angles, the intensities of different vibration modes are different, resulting in changes in the intensity distribution of Raman peaks. This results in that at different angles, the intensities of the two peaks are similar in some angles, while shoulders are formed in others, and the intensities are quite different. Since 30° − θ will return to the original atomic arrangement, the coupling of the two peaks of the 29° sample will be higher than that of 15° and 45°, and the $A_{1g}$ peak of the 29° sample is observed to couple almost two vibrational peaks into one peak. ,In line with expectations. By comparing the $A_{1g}$ peaks of the three samples, it can be seen that the relative rotation angles of different turning structures can be judged by the $A_{1g}$ peaks at different angles.At the same time, according to the similar positions and similar shapes of the $A_{1g}$ peaks at 15° and 45°, the following inferences are made: since the atomic arrangement of the rotation angle of 30° − θ and the rotation angle of 30° + θ is the same, the two samples with rotation angles are in the same arrangement. The Raman spectra should be the same. If the Raman spectra of rotation angles from 1° to 59° are compared and plotted, the shift of the peak position of this characteristic peak should form a \"v\"-shaped curve with 30° as the symmetry axis.Fig 3.5 - $E^1_{2g}$ peak of double-layer, qua-layer, 15◦, 29◦, 45◦ twisted samples at 633nm wavelength lightsFigure 3.5. shows the $E^1_{2g}$ peaks for the bilayer, qua-layer and twisted samples. Comparing the peaks of $E^1_{2g}$ of the five samples, it represents the relative motion of tellurium atoms and molybdenum atoms in the layer. Figure 3-3(b) can be observed, and the peak position and half-width of the peak remain unchanged. It cannot be a \"fingerprint\" for judging the size of a twisted degree.Fig 3.6 - $B^1_{2g}$ peak of double-layer, qua-layer, 15◦, 29◦, 45◦ twisted samples at 633nm wavelength lightsComparing the $B^1_{2g}$ peaks of the five samples in Figure 3.6., this peak represents the relative movement between the tellurium and molybdenum atomic layers. The number of layers and the rotation angle will affect the peak position and half-width of the vibrational peak. Comparing the qua-layer sample and the twisted sample, it can be found that there is a slight shift in the peak position and in the half-peak width, but the difference is not obvious, which can be used as an auxiliary judgment of the twisted size of the twisted structure. In addition, the peak shift of $B^1_{2g}$, which is closely related to the interlayer interaction, should show a \"v\"-shaped symmetrical curve similar to that of $A_{1g}$.The characteristic peak of the double resonance Raman related to the interlayer vibration is only $\\omega 4$, but because the peak intensity at this position is not large, and it is more affected by the Raman measurement system, it can only be used as a means to assist the judgment of the size of the rotation angle. It is not the most important best method.To sum up, for the characterization of the rotation angle of the twisted structure, the best judgment peak is the $A_{1g}$ peak, supplemented by the $B^1_{2g}$ and $\\omega 4$ vibration mode peaks. By comparing the difference of the peak positions and half-peak widths of these vibrational peaks, we can understand the changes of the phonon vibrational modes under different rotation angles. This \"Raman fingerprint\" can be used as one of the verifications for the preparation of the twisted structure in the future.According to the literature, the appearance of superlattices due to the Moiré pattern should give rise to new vibrational modes due to phonon folding effects. These Moiré Phonon-related vibrational modes have very narrow peak widths at half maximum and often appear near vibrational modes that arise from secondary scattering. However, after careful observation and analysis, this phenomenon could not be observed as expected in this experimental measurement.Chapter 4: ImprovementsAs mentioned in the previous chapter, no new vibrational modes associated with Moiré patterns have emerged in the experiments and Raman measurements of this project. There are two main reasons for this phenomenon: the preparation experiment itself and the measurement experiment. In terms of preparation experiments, the interaction between the upper and lower MoTe2 layers is not strong enough to make the superlattice vibration appear in new vibration modes. In terms of measurements, the occurrence of these modes cannot be observed because the vibrational modes caused by secondary scattering may be coupled with the vibrational modes caused by Moiré phonons at specific wavelengths. This chapter will illustrate these two aspects and propose experimental improvement schemes. The tentative experimental results of the current experimental improvement scheme will also be presented in this chapter.Twisted MoTe2 Fabrication ProcessAccording to the relevant literature, Moiré phonon vibrations are closely related to the interlayer interactions of the twisted structure, which means that the closer the layers are attached, the stronger the interaction, and the more likely it is to observe Moiré phonon-related Vibration mode. In order to improve the interlayer interaction, there are currently three main methods suitable for this experiment: 2D materials surface cleaning, AFM flattening technique, and thermal annealing.2D Materials Surface Cleaning and Related WorkIn order to make the prepared heterostructures have stronger interaction force and closer adhesion between layers, this has higher requirements on the cleanliness of the sample surface. As a result, researchers have developed a variety of surface cleaning methods to treat samples.One of the most common methods to clean the sample surface with organic solvents is organic solvents. Researchers often use organic solvents such as isopropanol, acetone, and anhydrous ethanol to process samples to dissolve the organics remaining from mechanical cleavage or other growth methods in these strong organic solvents to obtain relatively clean surfaces. However, during the cleaning process, the solvent or part of the organic matter on the sample is evenly distributed on the surface of the sample. The organic matter may float on the surface of the organic solvent, and when the sample is clamped, the organic matter on the surface may be brought back to the surface of the silicon wafer. Although this method is simple, it cannot completely remove the organic matter of the sample, and the residual degree of organic matter molecules is high.In addition to organic solvents cleaning, thermal annealing is also a common surface cleaning method. Under a certain high temperature, the organic matter on the sample is sublimated and taken away by the airflow under a stable airflow. In order to achieve the cleaning effect, the temperature of thermal annealing needs to be higher. [28] The researchers also developed an AFM surface cleaning method based on the principle of AFM cutting. The atomic force microneedle uses an appropriate amount of force to continuously scan the surface of the sample, sweeping the raised object to the edge of the sample to achieve a cleaning effect. Without scratching the sample, the greater the force exerted by the atomic force microneedle, the more obvious the cleaning effect. [29] In addition, in order to adapt to the surface cleaning of 2D materials in different environments, some researchers also use other methods to clean the surface. For example: in a cryogenic oven, it is difficult to anneal the crystal, and the researchers pass an electric current through the sample, and the residual particles are melted into a thin film due to Joule heat, or melted and sublimated to achieve surface cleaning. [31] The surface cleaning of samples with organic solvents cannot remove all residues from the surface, which cannot meet the requirements of the surface cleanliness of 2D materials in this experiment. For the thermal annealing method, since the high temperature will damage the crystal lattice of the MoTe2 sample, resulting in irreparable damage and affecting the subsequent experimental measurements, it cannot meet the experimental requirements of this project. For the MoTe2 used in this project, which is sensitive to temperature and requires high surface cleanliness, it is a feasible solution to locally clean the surface of the sample through atomic force microscopy. This method can meet the cleanliness requirements of the sample surface for this project, and the sample can be cleaned to a single atomic layer. At the same time, this method does not cause lattice damage to the sample.Atomic Force Microscope Surface CleaningIn order to clean the surface of the underlying 2D material, this project attempts to use AFM for surface cleaning. AFM surface cleaning is a localized, fine and almost non-destructive cleaning method. The surface cleaning of 2D materials can be achieved by controlling the appropriate force, that is, the force with which the AFM probe is closely attached to the surface of the sample without being scratched. The following shows the process: Replace the AFM probe dedicated to the contact mode; Position the sample under the microscope; Scan the topography of the sample using the semi-contact mode; Set the appropriate contact strength and scanning frequency, and scan the sample with the contact mode, and the scanning range is the area that needs to be cleaned; Clean several times until the required area surface is clean; Scan the topography of the sample using the semi-contact mode;In a preparative experimental refinement, an attempt was made to use AFM for surface cleaning, using less force than the force used for cutting. After two cleanings, it was observed that cleaning the surface by AFM contact mode does work. Before cleaning, the thickness of the sample was about 4nm. After cleaning by atomic force microscope, the thickness of the sample is reduced to nearly 1.5nm, which is close to the thickness of one atomic layer. Comparing the two, the difference between the uncleaned area and the cleaned area is 2.39 nm. This fully demonstrates that the scanning in the contact mode of the atomic force microscope has a good cleaning effect on the surface of the sample, and this method of cleaning the surface is feasible.Fig 4-1 - AFM Surface CleaningFigure 4.1. shows the AFM samples before and after cleaning. The area enclosed by the red outline in the right image of Figure 4-1b is the cleaned area. Comparing the cleaned area and the uncleaned area, it can be seen that the particles in the cleaned area are significantly reduced, and the surface is more uniform, which intuitively shows the effect of atomic force microscope surface cleaning.By cleaning the organic molecule residues in the lower layer sample by this method, the influence of organic molecules between the upper and lower interlayers can be reduced, thereby reducing the distance between the layers, or improving the interaction force between the layers.Interlayer Interaction Enhancement TechniquesIn addition to surface cleaning of the samples before preparation, the interlayer interaction can also be enhanced after preparation of the twisted samples. According to the literature read so far, there are two applicable methods: AFM flattening technique and thermal annealing method.AFM FlatteningFor twisted samples, the relative rotation angle increases the distance between the upper and lower layers. The larger the angle of relative rotation and the larger the distance, the greater the negative impact on the interaction between layers. In this project, AFM can not only be used for cutting and surface cleaning of the underlying sample surface, but also to enhance the interaction between layers through AFM flattening technology.According to relevant literature, due to the uneven substrate and insufficient pressing force during mechanical cleavage, the thickness of graphene is higher than that of a single layer of atoms, which shows that graphene is not tightly combined with the substrate. A close contact between the graphene and the substrate is achieved through the contact mode scanning of the atomic force microscope - to achieve flattening. Similar turning angle samples are not equal to the thickness of two layers of samples stacked directly, and the interaction is not tightly bound and the distance brought by the relative turning angle affects the interaction. Similar to surface cleaning, this method physically flattens the sample. The enhanced interaction is achieved by applying the appropriate force to the 2D sample, that is, the force that is tightly bound to the sample surface but fails to scrape the sample, scans the sample surface in AFM contact mode and reduces the thickness of the twisted sample force effect. This method does not cause damage to the sample surface and is the appropriate method for this project. The stronger the scan, the more obvious the cleaning effect. [30] Heat AnnealingAccording to relevant literature, the method of thermal annealing can remove the organic matter in the layer from the interlayer of the twisted structure under the dual action of high temperature and air flow, realize the cleaning in the layer and enhance the interaction force between the layers. At the same time, some related literature show that some modes cannot be excited due to the large interlayer distance in the unannealed sample. Since Moiré patterns are closely related to interlayer interactions, it is speculated whether annealing is a necessary experimental procedure to observe vibrational peaks associated with Moiré phonons. [32] When annealing temperature is between 150℃ and 200℃ in hydrogen and argon atmosphere.After the test after the experiment, this condition has no obvious negative effect on the Raman signal of molybdenum telluride, which can be applied to this project. [33,34] It is worth noting that some documents also mentioned that the high-temperature thermal annealing of the twisted graphene sample would change the angle of rotation and untwist. However, since the temperature has not reached very high, and the rotation angles of the twisted samples prepared in this project are all large, the influence of thermal annealing on the angle is within an acceptable range, so this method can be used to improve the interlayer interaction of the twisted samples. effect.Twisted MoTe2 Raman SpectroscopyIn this project, 633 nm excitation light was used for Raman spectroscopy measurements. According to Tan's research on MoS2 with constant rotation angle, the peak position and intensity of the vibrational peaks related to Moiré phonons under the excitation of different wavelengths of light will change. These characteristic peaks may be indistinguishable from those of the second-order Raman, so the Raman test from 1.83 eV-2.81 eV was performed. According to the results of this study, when the intensity of the excitation light is close to that of the C excitons of MoS2, the intensity of the modes associated with the Moiré phonon vibrational modes is enhanced, thereby inferring the resonance Raman effect of the moiré phonon is produced by the exciton effect. This means that the choice of excitation light intensity will affect the measurement of the Moiré phonon vibrational mode, so the subsequent experiments need to adjust the wavelength of the measurement to further understand the vibrational modes related to the twisted MoTe2.In addition to the need to perform Raman measurements of different wavelengths on the twisted samples, in order to fully understand the effect of moiré patterns on phonon vibration, low-wavenumber Raman should also be one of the research topics of twisted MoTe2, which should be further studied in the follow-up research.Further ResearchFurther Research is still ongoing now. The project is taken over by Shiyuan Wang.ConclusionsThis project mainly focuses on the study of the phonon vibration mode of twisted MoTe2. Through the process of mechanical cleavage, atomic force microscope cutting, and dry transfer, bi-layer and qua-layer were prepared, and the samples were measured in Raman Spectroscopy under excitation light of 633 nm. By analyzing the Raman spectra, the following conclusions are drawn: the $A_{1g}$ and $B^1_{2g}$ peaks related to the interlayer interaction can be used as the basis for judging the rotation angle of the twisted MoTe2. According to the symmetry of the atomic arrangement, it is predicted that the Raman frequency shift positions of these two vibrational modes of the twisted molybdenum telluride sample will form a \"v\"-shaped curve with 30° as the axis of symmetry between 1° and 59°. In this project, Raman vibrational modes associated with Moiré phonons were not expected to be observed.This project speculates that the failure to observe the Raman vibration peaks related to Moiré phonons is mainly due to the insufficient interlayer interaction force of the twisted sample and the wrong choice of wavelength for measurement. Based on the relevant literature and the results of subsequent exploratory experiments, this project proposes the following experimental improvements: AFM surface cleaning, AFM flattening technology, and thermal annealing technology. At the same time, other wavelengths of measurement light and low-wave number Raman measurements were added to complete the study of all phonon modes of twisted MoTe2.This project develops a stable twisted structure preparation scheme for 2D materials with relatively small areas that can only be obtained by mechanical cleavage methods. Without other 2D as supplement layers, it is friendly to the low-wavenumber Raman research in the follow-up on the interlayer interaction of the twisted 2D materials.Because Raman research is a powerful characterization method for comprehensively exploring all phonon modes of materials, and phonon vibrational modes can reflect crystal structure, crystal symmetry, defects and impurities, the development of stable twisted preparation technology enables more twisted samples The research is conducive to a clearer and comprehensive understanding of the mechanical properties, thermodynamic properties, electrical properties, optical properties and other material properties of this two-dimensional material system, and provides reference information for future device preparation and selection of material systems. The prepared twisted samples may also be used for the measurement of light absorption, photoluminescence, and second harmonics. The comprehensive characterization of the twisted samples will help to enhance the understanding of the properties of the twisted samples, and to apply their special properties to more in special devices. In addition, understanding the physical mechanism of phonon regulation of Moiré patterns is also conducive to the further development of \"phonon engineering\" to provide a physical basis for the preparation of devices with excellent phonon regulation.Reference[1] MOORE G E.
